@USAirways merging with American will negatively affect your quality and integrity. I will no longer fly with you because of it.
@united Anna Palm Springs gate 19  deserves a medal! Handled 30 ppl missing flights like a pro!
@united perfect! Thank you!
@USAirways @SDFAirport  I really needed to be back home yesterday and at work at 9am today. Been on plane and sitting for an hour #peeved
@united I hope so too :)
‚Äú@united: @SonyaSloanMD Happy to have had you on board. Please share details here: http://t.co/2TrgEMteBZ ^KP‚Äù Done!
@AmericanAir I've flown you many years without a complaint. You should start listening to your customers.  You went from first to worst
@united Luckily I made my flights this time but was so disappointed with the lack of communication :(
@AmericanAir and even worse, by the time you responded to my tweets I took two flights over five hours. And that was the quickest response!
@USAirways just noticed that I don't believe I saw a confirmation for a flight I bought a few weeks ago. Def paid though. #help #resend?
@united I'm extremely disappointed w my service for this trip as a #United #MileagePlus Explorer Card holder.
@united @ShowExpert what is going on with United's Mileage Program? You pay $500 for a ticket and get a fraction of that as PQD credit?
@USAirways I'm trying to Cancelled Flight my flight within the 24hr window but have been on hold for over an hour. Is there an alternate # I can dial?
@JetBlue Hey Jetblue, you stranded an entire plane that was supposed to go to JFK and we are getting restless.  Need better communication!
@USAirways would have been nice to be offered in flight credit. Especially since I'm staring at empty overhead room.
@JetBlue That makes two of us! Lol #Blushing
STAHP!! üòÇüòÇüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ RT @JetBlue Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/BM2unRaOnI
@JetBlue why did I pay for extra space to be forced to put my backpack under my seat? Its my only bag. Flight 135. Unprofessional.
@JetBlue: DCA to Nantucket - Washington Business Journal http://t.co/ebxC94kFJD
@AmericanAir would also like say kind move on adding the points !
@AmericanAir Thanks for asking On second plane after maintenance issue, for flight from ORD to LIT. Sitting at gate in very very warm plane
@JetBlue as a customer it feels like i should stick to airlines other than jet blue. I travel for my work for past 5 years never seen $70
Made it to #Costa #Rica and back @JetBlue Missing it already!  #Pura #Vida!
@JetBlue flight 672 delayed from 9:30 to 11:47 now, still sitting on runway over 15 minutes so far. Air travel at its best.

@JetBlue we've been on the runway for over an hour. Now the water pressure is low and taxiing back for maintenance. #1572
@AmericanAir it's been 2 hrs of wait on the phone a) worst customer services b) trying to know where my suitcase Is and way MORE üò§#ANGRY
@JetBlue Btw, thanks for responding quickly!!

@UsAirways can a real person help me here? This customer service is poor. I'm at the mercy of someone since the flights are disappearing.
@JetBlue thanks for your reply. It was flight 1572.
@USAirways membership has no privileges anymore - my son is in the army, short window to see him - NO help.
@AmericanAir Who do I report missing baggage to when baggage claim leaves before midnight?
@AmericanAir Hands down the worst airline to travel with. Really really fucking bad.
.@united nothing apparently. I've flown w/ you 4 times in last 3 weeks and 3 of those experiences (incl today) were clusterfucks.
@JetBlue I like Marie Harf go to Iraiq find ISIS and spread good, and offer resume service to ISIS in order to find jobs @marieharf
@united perfect! That works! Thank you!
@united Flight UA1270 is descending into farce and we haven't left EWR yet. Is this going to get any worse?
.@SouthwestAir Well, we all need something to aim for.
@united @lpdstock tweet bots obviously don't get sarcasm, making computers more and more like real people.
@USAirways CLT, please send more than one cust svc rep to your cust svc counter to assist a line out the door. http://t.co/v24QNp3DOi
@USAirways yes but again valuable time has been lost
Always been a @JetBlue fan but maybe next time I'll fly @VirginAmerica for real customer service.
@AmericanAir my flight has been delayed &amp; I can't talk reach anyone in customer service because of high call volume.
@USAirways flights keep getting delayed and Cancelled Flighted with no information, worst customer service ever.
@AmericanAir  800 number will not even let you wait for next customer rep. Very frustrating. Can't talk to humans.
@VirginAmerica you are failing your customers because your check in process does not link to TSA pre-check.
@united they helped me at the baggage service desk.  Said bc TSA screening was down in FLL not all bags made it but bag will be in EWR @ 12
@USAirways @AmericanAir I am so going to miss US Airways.  You always provided great service and NEVER LET ME DOWN.
@USAirways going to miss my connection because my flight home has been delayed and now no gate agent to get us off the plane-so frustrated
@JetBlue oh. Makes sense. My bad.
@SouthwestAir can tweet through the weekend/ bad weather, but closes down customer relations center to process refunds for Cancelled Flighted flights.
@JetBlue you are officially my favorite, thank you for the wonderful service at JFK
‚Äú@AmericanAir: @TheCandaceSmith Thanks for the shout-out, Candace! Enjoy the ride.‚Äù Always! I adore American Airlines!
@SouthwestAir wouldn't it be awesome for my first time flying to be #DestinationDragons?!
@AmericanAir would you like any additional details of my issue? Airport, flight, agent name? Or are you happy w/ this automated lip service?
@AmericanAir your call system is a fucking joke
@united I know. I‚Äôm sure you hear it all the time ‚Äî don‚Äôt like the new seats. I‚Äôm a small guy, 5‚Äô 6‚Äù and I feel the new planes are tight

@united really enjoying my Sunday on hold...over 1 hour. Perhaps a better client experience is needed. http://t.co/8VnCKgZxl1
@united Also, group 5 is total BS.
@united not yet. I complained about the guy who checked my luggage in as he was throwing the bags around. Unfortunate coincidence I hope?
@united, take a look at status of 683, sitting at ORD ... This ain't cool, yo.
@united need to add service dog to my itinerary for tomorrow
@AmericanAir Glad to hear that there were no serious injuries in the minor crash @dfwairport this evening.
@JetBlue Sent an email more than 24 hours ago asking a few questions, still no response. Need answers before (hopefully) Flight Booking Problems flight...
@USAirways 4420 delayed further?
@JetBlue she was a phone agent, pls do! Peggy was pleasant, informative and delivered. ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
@united It wasn't full, I had plenty of time to go to the gate and check, plus with my status I should have gotten on!?!
@AmericanAir all I want is to know what to do regarding my connecting flights since my 1st is Cancelled Flightled. Could you be of assistance?
@united Cancelled Flights flt from EWR. "No crew".Tells wife &amp; 4 yr old to "get to NY to catch @AirCanada" to YYZ! Good #customerservice is dead.
@SouthwestAir #Vegas I was there 5 days ago. Miss the  Warm Weather
@SouthwestAir love how "friendly" your staff is when asking for updates on delayed flights causing missed connections. #horribleattitudes
@SouthwestAir still haven't left @BWI. Maybe by the time I'm suppose to fly back to Austin on Tuesday we'll have moved.
@USAirways I've flown 6 figured worth of miles in my lifetime.  This was my first and last ever flight on US Airways
@United Brothers baggage was lost on route to 2015 Panamerican Cross Country Cup Championship in Columbia. His race is Sunday. Please help.

@united or frontier ... http://t.co/n8WiNFu6C5
@VirginAmerica your airline is awesome but your lax loft needs to step up its game. $40 for dirty tables and floors? http://t.co/hy0VrfhjHt
@USAirways Please don't trivialize me.  This is a joke, not a slow day or slow experience
@united Thank You
@usairways  this is ridiculous at CLT  and we missed our connecting flight because of a chuckhole  on runway??  #shameful (1/1)
@united It was last night's 1235/ORD-LGA.
@SouthwestAir briughy me to @ComClassic, #AIF2015 &amp; so much more with the #agcommunity
@united @perfectomobile You really shouldn't use the word 'crashing.' Just sayin'.

@USAirways I will send an email with details Late Flightr. Thank you for responding.
@USAirways Really hoping I don't get charged for this flight because they couldn't handle the influx of calls. Bummer.
@united can you get me on the delayed flight to EWR out of YYZ at 15:30? No customer service to be found in airport
@SouthwestAir do we get to pick which @Imaginedragons show? #DestinationDragons
@AmericanAir finally at final destination but not w/o extra significant travel expenses &amp; missed work. How can you resolve this experience?
@JetBlue I would go to Dallas to see my grand baby that I miss so much. I feel like a piece of my heart is there.
@JetBlue Same exact flight too. Love JetBlue. Really want to fly with ya'll. But that's a little pricey for basic (not Mint). BOS to SFO.
@AmericanAir how do I see your report team?
@JetBlue my SIL bought tix for us to NYC. We were told at the gate that her cc was declined. Supervisor accused us of illegal activity.
@SouthwestAir me again! I was just trying to rebook fare on wanna get away pricing and it disappeared in time I refreshed. Is this normal?
So relieved I'm flying @JetBlue after listening to everyone at the neighboring gate bitch about Spirit. My airline's better than yours.
..... Can you not? ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/udPq0flIQo‚Äù

@JetBlue @weepysweetmonty i heard youre planning on letting people fly in the overhead compartments. why would you do that?
@JetBlue has the worst customer service out of any airline company. #dontflythem
@AmericanAir I really hope it departs. They said is because the catering service wasnt available but we can see it next to plane doing nthin
@AmericanAir Not okay. Since you couldn't put me on an earlier flight, I had to buy my own ticket on another airline.
@AmericanAir Asked for a waiver of a change fee for flight booked w/in past 24 hrs. Rep was rude. Just told me no. Didn't even try to help!
.@AmericanAir Flight 654 Delayed / Flight 409 You sold my seat / flight 0671 strand me in PHX for three hours. Thanks for the memories üò°üò§üòñüò≤üò©
@JetBlue she did. she's still waiting on a callback....the lack of follow through is what's concerning. smh
@JetBlue Thanks for having us hang out at Tampa Airport forever today!!! It's really been an awesome experience
@USAirways Instructions say to CALL. I'm just doing what it said to do.
@JetBlue #Bluemanity @AirlineAdviser loves this. Have a great time flying this
@JetBlue When chging flight, isit possible to pay the fare difference in dollars when the ticket was bought completely via point redemption?
@united  bags left behind because plane overweight, be great if knew as soon as we landed, instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info.
I know you have a lot of baggage... But i want you to know i really enjoyed being inside you. @JetBlue #Jetbae

@united Why was I forced to check my rollaboard on UA 715? Plenty of room in the overhead next to my seat. http://t.co/5xvNnmLTiW
@VirginAmerica It's fine. Already done with my purchase. But you should try it. Just go most of the way through then go back 3
@JetBlue Oh I will. #Disney bound. #workhard #playsoon
@SouthwestAir 9 hrs in Baltimore, still not going to get my baggage to greenville w me. This is just unbelievable.

@SouthwestAir we've now lost a whole day of our honeymoon... Very disappointed and frustrated with everything.
@SouthwestAir I luv y'all but please stop overheating your planes. Second flight in a row that feels like a sauna.
@VirginAmerica classiq, luv Virgin America. Greetingz
@SouthwestAir did you know that suicide is the second leading cause of death among teens 10-24
@SouthwestAir thank you for handling this for me. Glad Southwest cares about what it's flyers think!
@AmericanAir @united we'll have time and they aren't doing a damn thing. I'm the guy in the winter hat and frowny face
@SouthwestAir yes, thank you. Just sent DM.
@USAirways is the real MVP for holding up the flight connecting Philly to Tampa.
@USAirways / @AmericanAir don't forget without your customers you would be out of business! #epicfail #usairwaysfail
@USAirways you got to be "F"ing kidding me Usairways, 2hours on hold listening to yall selling loans and Valentine Flowers...SMFH
@United why is it so impossible to actually get a passenger AND their luggage to their final destination?
@AmericanAir I need a flight out tonight. Isn't there anything else?
@VirginAmerica SFO-PDX schedule is still MIA.
@USAirways I called more than 25 times to redeem mile points and can't get through.  You advertise the miles but make them very hard to use!
@SouthwestAir I left something on a plane landing at Midway last night because I am a responsible adult -- got a number for me to call? TY!
@AmericanAir gotta be worse than @delta w/ on time departures.  I rushed back to terminal C for 8:25 flight but they haven't strtd boarding.
@united I guess that's not the busiest route, so based on traffic/fuel costs, regional jet is the decision, but still not great 4 travelers.
@USAirways the least comforting thing from your pilot after sitting on a stationary plane for 3 hours is "I don't really know what happened"
@JetBlue Follow me pls?
@united what the hell? Flight 746. Delayed since 3 pm, finally boarded and now sitting on the tarmac? Is this f&amp;&amp;%$cking plane Ever leaving?
@SouthwestAir #JamesAsworth has the worst corporate account manager #22 Brent. I will now take my 70plus flights to @Delta thank you
@USAirways can you priv chat to help chairman reroute
@united hi JP, with the help of an awesome TSA representative, I was able to get it all taken care of. Thank you!
@AmericanAir my mom tried also. That wasn't the reason they wouldn't change it. Y'all literally said that you'd rather have an empty seat.
@JetBlue not to mention the fact that we paid extra just to fly jetblue thinking it was the most reliable..
@united was a sponsor of the oscars? No wonder it was a half hour delayed. #Oscars
@USAirways I don't need to rebook I need to know the policy
@JetBlue Just got the time to reply and share my thoughts in greater detail via web form.
@SouthwestAir LACMA on Fairfax.
@USAirways when will FLT 445 get a gate at DEN? Over 20 minutes waiting with no information.
@USAirways -doing best??? Think not. Lousy way to run an airline. Why no online way to connect? You be on hold for 2hrs &amp; then zip
@usairways Thanks to Kevin and team at F38ish at PHL for some great service recovery tonight. Appreciate it.
@USAirways actually it landed in BWI 30 minutes ago. She is stranded but I have friends to help. You FAILED big time on this one.
@USAirways I've been on hold for 90 minutes. This is terrible customer service. You messed up my reservation! http://t.co/oyLgeao7Y8

@USAirways @AmericanAir @SVLLINDIA provides you the best logistics experience for people all over India.#Mumbai #Surat #NaviMumbai
@united keep me updated. Let me know that the bags make the flight to j-burg
@VirginAmerica Only thing I see on passbook is Virgin Mobile Mexico. How do I integrate?
@united you guys need some serious training in customer service. Too many better options to put up with the way you guys handle ur mistakes
@united thanks again for your concern. I will contact customer care upon our return from Australia.
@united actually we aren't. Still parked here.
@AmericanAir No I do not have them yet. Called for baggage status 5 times yesterday.
@united Your ERI-ORD express connections are hugely popular .. now if only we could have an ERI-EWR hop! :)
@AmericanAir my 2498 to CLT left the gate. What is next for CLT. Need help

@SouthwestAir your wifi is angering me with its slowness
@VirginAmerica Why is the site down?  When will it be back up?
@JetBlue and stranded passengers aren't being helped to get another flight?
@VirginAmerica Only way to fly! #Elevate #Gold
@united But it's doubtful he'll fly United again and he will be traveling a lot as a sales manager covering all of North America
Awesome! RT @VirginAmerica: Watch nominated films at 35,000 feet. #MeetTheFleet #Oscars http://t.co/DnStITRzWy
@united I appreciate your efforts getting me home!
@SouthwestAir Incredibly frustrating. I emailed but still haven't received a response.
@AmericanAir Gabriela in Miami is a very rude employee.Working the MIA-LGA check In. She made experience unpleasant.  #customerexperience
@united nexus confirmed that at any crossing via air, car or boat she can travel with only Nexus.
@USAirways I followed you complaint procedure only to get a run around.  Your service SUCKS #usairwayssuck
@USAirways XNA has TSA Precheck! Would be nice if your system knew that.
@united yes I filed a claim &amp; hope to receive by luggage by 2am. Ridiculous as I had to purchase items to go to sleep &amp; no reimbursement.
@AmericanAir is there any way you could put me up in a hotel for the night?? If not I'm having to sleep at the airport again tonight.
@SouthwestAir Customer Centricity is knowing people #ANAMarketers

@VirginAmerica what happened to Doom?!
@USAirways worst trip ever!  Wish pilot would've let me off plane at 12pm during 1st delay.  Now 1030pm and still sitting on runway.
@AmericanAir agents refuse to help, "too busy" &amp; need to call advantage#. NO ONE willing to help and apparently being exec plat means ZERO
@USAirways  my flight was #3729...but I left my phone on the plane or the shuttle :(
@JetBlue yes, today. Flight is full now. They said no to me at gate :(
@USAirways why the hell did you overbook a plane when you knew people actually had seat assignments. #inept #uncaring #piss poorplanning
@United pre-dawn flight to #miami from #EWR. Annual #SOBEWFF trip. Now.
@AmericanAir really needs to get a a clue and start treating people like humans, not animals.  #americandairlinesSUCKS
@VirginAmerica Hi, I'm trying to do check-in but the website is not working. I tried 3 different browsers and the problem continues
@USAirways Your whole handling of this was a joke.Boston Logan had one little old lady,ONE handling all the customers http://t.co/DH2rfUIJYP
@united thanks ... not sure arranged move to the earlier flight but I'm at the gate with a seat assignment.  Super nice agent at gate C4 ORD
@southwestair watching planes do their thing https://t.co/iItoJhUIKH
@united fair enough, but it stinks to be the passenger on the plane that leaves the gate then sits on the tarmac for an hour before takeoff
@united by the time I finally get to Dallas I could have driven with less frustration and cheaper.
@AmericanAir 3349, was supposed to be in little rock at 10am this morning.
@JetBlue messaged you, thanks
@united It was 3387. But we helped you with the weight issue, took your vouchers, and hopped on a @Delta flight instead. #winwin
@united   It's too bad UA has had another unforeseeable operational issue on my return flight.
@AmericanAir You Cancelled Flight my flight and there‚Äôs no way to rebook on the website or app? I have to wait 35 minutes on hold? #fail cc @Delta
@JetBlue Still love you guys. But get me to Vegas already! ‚òÄÔ∏èüå¥‚úàÔ∏èüç∏üé≤

@SouthwestAir Promotion also said two free round trip flights. Nope, had to pay $200 extra for chi to Vegas. Bait&amp;switch.

@united not just refunded, but for those of us who are on vacation to get a free room night to make up for making us sleep in DIA
@united any chance flight 3745 is being delayed??  nervous about driving to DFW in this weather to drop off my brother

Thank you. ‚Äú@AmericanAir: @jlhalldc Customer Relations will review your concerns and contact you back directly, John.‚Äù
@JetBlue  I shouldn't have to find them, they should tell us. I've flown Jet Blue since your first month. The experience isn't what it was.
@AmericanAir can you use the aa credit platinum select world mastercard for Alaska flights?  Or just american?
@USAirways I'm shutting my data off for the flight. I want some response by the time I land.  You have 2 hours.
@united You load our plane at ORD knowing pilots are 2 hrs Late Flight, then discover plane needs to be fueled? #WTF #united #incompetent
@JetBlue after boarding flight 0510, the captain informs that he could exceed the16 hrs regulation and turned the plane around. Incredible!
@SouthwestAir Flight was Cancelled Flighted, I've been on hold for 50 minutes with no human interaction. I wanna get away.
@united I guess that's too much ask, huh?
@JetBlue I appreciate the credit for my troubles but the lack of personal response troubles me.
@SouthwestAir thank you. Great customer service so far. Accidents happen I understand. Hopefully everything works out.
@USAirways how do I find an email address regarding reativation of dividend miles. Nothing on website
@United give me a direct number I can call regarding my lost baggage immediately.
@JetBlue we've been delayed for almost 2 hrs. I take JetBlue because I've had good luck, but today is really frustrating.
@united worst airline ever. Thanks for the slew of rude agents and staff making my delayed flights even worse.
@AmericanAir You've now put me on a BA flight - can I get access for 2 for the lounge? Been at ORD for 11.5 hrs now and still have 5 to go.
@united hahahahaha ya tried that already
@united not sure why u call it customer care.  Should be customer we don't care
@AmericanAir your call center won't let me wait on hold, which I would happily do. Am I seriously supposed to just keep calling? Not great
@SouthwestAir round-trip tickets just arrived for our auction at the Post-Masters Invitational! Thanks Southwest! http://t.co/mRfBjtePef
@AmericanAir Love the new planes for the JFK-LAX run.  Maybe one day I will be on one where the amenities all function.  #NoCharge #Ever
@JetBlue that's what we've been told however how would this work if you're going overseas? Bottom line is passengers feel as if there's (1)
@AmericanAir I called the EP line and 4 hours Late Flightr I was called back.  I sat on hold for over a hour to US Airways and then cut off
Just got off the phone @AmericanAir customer service. Only 8 minutes to get my issue resoled. You guys are awesome.
@SouthwestAir Great trip on 2672 yesterday - outstanding flight attendants
@VirginAmerica YES FYI  MY BFF
@united Do you also want the naming rights to my first child so I can fly home and visit with my mother and avoid more winter depression?
@JetBlue may I check my 17-month-old child's fold-up crib for free on my flight tomorrow, similar to your policy for infant car seats?
@AmericanAir Thank you, you too!
@JetBlue Any option for luggage assistance on the ground at HPN? Flight 2168 delayed 2+ hours &amp; we will have 2 sleeping kids when we land
@SouthwestAir I am following you now. I don't think I can DM until you follow me.
@USAirways  ok my 4th try today....giving up at 12.45am after 138 minute hold time. #terrible http://t.co/Ps9Q9RPSiL
@united how long will it take for miles that i re-purchased (they had expired) to show up? I recieved an email that the request had been..
@AmericanAir @united You're both equally terrible, and I'm going to fight until I get complete satisfaction for how we were mistreated
@JetBlue @NHLBruins repping the Bruins in Cleveland at Rock n Roll HOF &amp; The Christmas Story house #JetBlueBruins http://t.co/JKnWuGJ778
@JetBlue Maybe stop telling people the wrong info on your customer service calls.
@SouthwestAir I can. Doesn't it seem fair that if our bags need to fit under our seats, we should need to fit in them?
@JetBlue Re: Flight 8088 SXM&gt;JFK what time does bus leave hotel on Feb 22?  Mass confusion here.
@united Could you tell me if this bag would be accepted as a personal item ? Can i bring one carry-on bag plus this? http://t.co/U390cZpLHl
@AmericanAir my flight got Cancelled Flightled from GRK to DFW, then to LEX for tomorrow and I need it rebooked.
@SouthwestAir I receive bad customer service and ended up spending several hundred dollars to accommodate my family during each cxl flight
@united Hi, booked a flight yesterday and received an email w/ confirmation number but today I got this error "no active flight segments"
@JetBlue what is the name of this tailfin? http://t.co/qxV45MV0Ug
@AmericanAir why do #exp members have to wait "over 2 hours" to speak with an operator? Surely this is a mistake?
@USAirways more like USDELAY-ways. Another long 'paperwork' reLate Flightd delay - Friday in Charlotte. Today in Philly. #letsgoalready
@VirginAmerica Comenity Bank is a joke!  Please change.  Nothing but constant problems with this bank
@AmericanAir I understand you are busy but I have still gotten no answer. I need to get home and you guys have not helped at all
@SouthwestAir Booked 6mos early, paid for Early check in, was ASSIGNED boarding #, here 3hrs early and you deleted me in error?! #LAS2BUF
@USAirways so you don't have a pilot now for #clt ‚úà #ord for at least another hour. Why on earth would you board the plane? Makes no sense!
@SouthwestAir some woman gets on plane and holds 2 seats in the bulkhead for her friends with C boarding passes. I paid $ earlybird thx
@SouthwestAir I will tell marry a lamp if you give me tickets to the Vegas show please I am desperate
@VirginAmerica announced New Route to Austin w/fares from $39/way. http://t.co/gA8pbamu0C
@USAirways 1729 connecting in charlotte to houston. Mechanical issue determined while q'd to take off. And we checked our bags.
@united was such a better airline when you were Continental. $75 service fee + $75 Flight Booking Problems fee + $25 talk to a human fee: FU!!!
@united Second day &amp; attempt trying to leave IAD &amp; I'm on another plane delayed for mechanical issues. Over an hour delayed!
@USAirways @united really know how to leave someone stranded after a funeral. Props to you guys. Really making this the perfect Monday.
@jetblue that's cause we're TrueBlue! It's ur #love that keeps liftin' me #higherandhigher https://t.co/xGfS6tJTMo http://t.co/ixM3t5mIZc
@USAirways stranded in Philly- #Starving and can't get a meal voucher even though your plane had mechanical issue /  next flight in 10 hrs
@AmericanAir I wish I could remember all of their names!
@AmericanAir a phone call or email when you Cancelled Flight a flight would be lovely.
@JetBlue hopefully this flight Seattle to Boston 2pm will have wifi. Our first one did not and we had to entertain ourselves! #lizaapproved
.@JetBlue Wish you would make Austin, TX a hub. Missing you as my ‚Äúonly‚Äù airline for all my biz travel since I moved from BOS. :(
@AmericanAir at JFK flight to Boston delayed 20 min waiting for catering they are boarding flight to LAX waiting for over and hour WTF?
@united your website was down all day yesterday- tried 3x put all info in&amp;didnt go thru- today the flight I bought went up!
@USAirways me too!
@USAirways @PRof_Solutions Be prepared for 3+ hours hold times
@united Did somebody say flight upgrade?
@AmericanAir What are we going to do about the nightmare you guys out me through yesterday? Zero response from the tweet you last sent me.
@united thanks. Just was able to do it on the app myself. Still not customer service to be seen in YYZ
@JetBlue Tell me more üò≥...Because I need a 1 way to NYC, and I might choose you
@AmericanAir You guys are totally losing me. I've been an AA fan for years but telling me reps are busy and hanging up on me is really bad.
@SouthwestAir we had early bird, and it was great. Your employees were awesome. It was 3 passengers who killed the buzz.
@JetBlue u suck Big Donkey Balls!
@united you have a culture issue
@united web app won't let me upgrade seats, call center wait time is 20 minutes plus, just want to get more legroom but it's a pita
@southwestair - kind of early but any idea when dates through the first week of sept will come available?
@united Couldn't use the confirmed upgd cert you gave me b/c you decided to sell anyone a biz seat for $299. Why do you bother giving them?
@united @Adam_Karren @zj76 how did you save the $200 on checked snowboard? Trying to check in this morning, website wants $200! (prem.gold)
@united thanks KP.  What's going on w/4840 tonight.  Bad update online and phone. Can't u give customers good info. Not waste their time?!
@USAirways  Mad love http://t.co/4ojrSDWPkK NYC-
@AmericanAir SFO. Natt (the agent who helped me) really did an awesome job.
@USAirways and no one has been at all helpful. I will never fly this airline again. #NeverAgain #spreadtheword
@AmericanAir @USAirways and the way I have been spoken to by #DFW and #Mia employees is truly disgusting. Save the pain fly with anyone else
@united next flight? Don't think I'll be spending anymore money with you guys ever. It was that bad.
@USAirways Are you guys awake? Need help with delayed flight to get protected on Late Flightr flight from PHL.
@USAirways on top of that a dozen ppl missed connections and you have ONE person at customer service? Abysmal!
@USAirways this has been my WORST flying experience with you guys, you need to do better
@SouthwestAir I didn't say anything about patience, I said this is probably the last time I fly Southwest. I suggest others do the same.
@united Sivi Stewart at Lax was fantastic tonight helping to find a lost item for us at the airport.  Much thanks!
@JetBlue FYI, I'm onboard #616 comfortably travelling to JFK, seat was no problem as you said. Thanks for making flying more civilized!
@JetBlue im flying with you from mi-boston and then icelandair to iceland, 8 hours between. can we check our bags all the way?
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/H11jglw74L‚Äùayyy üòé
@SouthwestAir though I work for another major airline,  I LOVE your Black history month commercial. I Thank you.
@united @SCVPools Please call me at 310-795-2210.
@USAirways sitting on the ground in Charlotte with no gate or comms for flight deck great happy Friday hope i make my connection
@USAirways made it!!! Send Bloody Mary's to row 27!!!
@USAirways : Maybe You Should Drive #usairwaysfail
@AmericanAir i hope it takes you 6 hours to get home when it should take 20. my flight was Cancelled Flightled because they "couldn't staff the plane"
@SouthwestAir WiFi on yesterday's flight extremely slow a waste of $8 and lost the travel time for work.
@JetBlue need flight to ATH from PDX. Do you coordinate with other airlines?
@JetBlue apparently the plane was delayed coming up from San Juan. Monsoon there today?
@USAirways figure it out, have had 2 Cancelled Flightled flights in the past week. Now coming home 2 hour delay, and cart that pulls plane just broke
@united can't believe United can't find someone to just simply check a seat back for a missing passport. Loved United but debating choice
@SouthwestAir So far so good! http://t.co/16c9ex79Rk
@JetBlue actually they said the fraud issue was never resolved. but why then did they issue me a new ticket of the phone?
@united comically on the return flight from ASE there were two United flights boarding at adjacent gates and not clear which plane to board
@americanair thanks for no fresh food on my cross country flight and for making my connection so close No time to eat. TPA-DFW-LAX
@united @gg8929 I'm sorry United isn't able to keep its word 'cuz their IT is totally inadequate but they still says it's a customer fault!
@SouthwestAir - just got it back about 20 mins ago. Went about 18 hrs w/o it but I appreciate the support. $50 voucher + $50 for essentials.
@JetBlue 's free wifi on board is the best thing that's happened since sliced bread
@SouthwestAir Been on hold 34 min so far trying to book seat for my infant. Price increased $42 in meantime. What do I do?
@SouthwestAir change your hold music, going on hour 3 and i'm about to loose it
@AmericanAir Thank you for holding, we apologize for the delay in answering your call. To speak to a representative please continue to hold.
@USAirways is there an additional charge for a golf bag with clubs , shoes, and golf balls, if that's the only piece of luggage you check?
@USAirways need to retrain US 3837 lead flight attendant and gate agent at arrival MKE 2/23.  Horrible attitudes toward helping customers.
@united and those three people were awesome working very long hours. It is easy to say sorry on Twitter but you should help your ppl @EWR
@JetBlue tell your employees that!
@VirginAmerica should I be concerned that I am about to fly on a plane that needs to be delayed due to a "tech stop"?
@USAirways Would love to combine AA and USAir accts. Unfortunately, one has my middle name &amp; one has middle initial. Won't allow change
@USAirways  and now I'm going to miss my G'ma's Memorial because I didn't #FlyDelta.
@JetBlue my phone number when you have any news for me is (631)891-5722
@AmericanAir  is the worst airline to ever travel with!!!! The worst!! They're equivalent to DIRT!!!!!!
@JetBlue thank you guys! You are the best! üôå‚úàÔ∏è
@JetBlue and @WSJ team up offering in-flight access to journal content http://t.co/PTsbkA4cDJ
@united they let us board again but will we fly this time? Who knows! #shouldhaveflowndelta
@united we followed the baggage rules on your website and was still charges $150. But only going one way
@AmericanAir yeah and what are they gunna? Nothing your whole organization is a joke
@united you are by far the worst airline. 4 plane delays on 1 round trip flight. How is that possible.
@AmericanAir just when I thought you guys were done messing up, you make it worse. Your airline ruins hopes and dreams.
@united its ridic you cant transfer credit, you have my $400 &amp; youre taking $200 of it for Cancelled Flightling. Atleast let me keep the credit damn
@united that's what I tried to do, but when entering email into 2nd device made email typo. No way to fix it &amp; no option to log out/in!!!
@JetBlue ask @j_beatz247 but I teach marketing at a university and will gladly consult on customer service and how NOT to treat passengers.
@AmericanAir pretty bad at #DFW no updates two flights behind doors open breeze no America airlines workers http://t.co/6MBK79mdnW
Wanted to get my bag benefit, but instead get $25 pricing on all three tickets. When adding a card, MP Visa is only option. @united
@united and that plane was staying overnight at the next airport - ROC. U can make up 10 min in air but instead of waiting u leave EARLY
Oh yeah? RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/FTv2NWWQF1‚Äù
@united day 3 of this Saga maybe they'll finally make it home.Intentional or not it not gonna get them back there vacation days #badservice
@VirginAmerica Is it normal to receive no reply from Central Baggage #baggageissues #smh
@united why de-ice before taxing? Maybe it #makestoomuchsense ? #shouldhaveflowndelta #unitedsucks @Delta @SouthwestAir @AmericanAir
@united thanks for listening! I definitely was not the only person in line who thought it was absurd.
@JetBlue they booked me for tomorrow. It's $250 higher. My 1st reservation is PGFRYZ. Get me on standby list 4 tonight would help.
@united my coworker that had the same conflict as me with the hotel issue trying to share posted on their facebook page and they erased it!!
@united it would be super if you paid as much attention to actual fliers as you do to credit card holders.
@AmericanAir it looks like a mistake
@AmericanAir called executive platinum desk and got a TWO HOUR call back time... 2.5 hrs Late Flightr still no call and still stuck in Chicago
@USAirways I have nothing but issues when I fly w/u what's up w/that?! #travel #vacation #awful
@USAirways got transf. to Dividend Miles...need to change flight.  Grandma just passed, need to change ticket ASAP. Update on wait time?
@SouthwestAir  Tried to leave Monday, all other planes left but mine. Now this one keeps getting delayed. Missed work. Have to pay for a cab
@united the lack of customer service is astounding https://t.co/72RMpkOGwu #2daysofhell
@SouthwestAir took our carryon bag with essential attire for a life changing interview tomorrow &amp; it's not here; can we expect compensation?
@united OMG!!! you just bumped me off the last flight. Can this get any worse.
@SouthwestAir u have a lot of pissed off hungry tired people stuck at midway 4 over 2 hours after scheduled departure. This is inexcusable
@united:  thanks for the miserable trip GNV&lt;&lt;&lt;FSD on 2.19-2.21.
@united - you rebooked me to UA1764 after UA 3883 was Cancelled Flightled. I paid for first class ticket - but new seat is 38E. Can you please fix!
@JetBlue excited for my first flight w/ you today! It's delayed though- can you give me the 411? Flight number 989 from Boston to DC
@united If you'd love to see more girls be inspired about becoming pilots, RT our free WOAW event March 2-8 at ABQ. http://t.co/rfXlV1kGDh
@USAirways you're the only airline that's not open sooner. It's not a confidence booster.
@united then send your Jeff Smisek on a trip with JetBlue or SW and make sure he takes notes. I would never choose to fly United again.
@AmericanAir Karen Riedel is a rock star employee and a miracle worker.  I really appreciated her help this morning!
@united I'm strongly considering taking my business elsewhere. #UnitedAirlines
@USAirways I intend to..very much. My 4,000 followers will as well.
@USAirways I did and it's been a disaster. You had me sitting on the runway only to bring the plane back to the gate smh
@united I am very glad I took care of own rescheduling now that UA 1580 from OGG was Cancelled Flightled. http://t.co/H3k3oWOhD1
@AmericanAir thanks to your attendant on flight for advising connect flight held.  Ran with kids and flight departed. Poor service at Miami
@united thanks for reminding me how much easier it is to fly Southwest!  Get more agents at sfo 25!
@JetBlue you guys operate a world class company and for that I thank you
@AmericanAir Flight 1512 (N924AN) departs @FlyTPA enroute to @dfwairport http://t.co/j0mhMkDiVl
@SouthwestAir luggage delivery between 1-4am? Really? After I was told by midnight multiple times? Why lie? Crazy and bad business.
@united just 1 last thing. U guys shouldn't be charging $ for drinks on a transatlantic flight
@united to recap, you bounced me off my flight, LIED TO ME, then hung up on me. What am I supposed to think/do now?
@AmericanAir Are you kidding? You don't think I've done that?? I've called dozens of times &amp; it tells me to call back &amp; hangs up.
@JetBlue had a great experience working with Glenn Coles at Buffalo-Niagara Airport!! Top notch employee
@JetBlue well duh. My grandfather just got hired as a TSA agent and currently at PWM!
@united okay. Thanks.
@AndrewFallis same here! On hold for an hour &amp; then told @USAirways has done all it is willing to- which was apologize. #stillnotonmyflight
@JetBlue well mine sure aren't anything to write home about!
@United #1758 now going in 40 min waiting for other plane to vacate gate. #findanothergate
@AmericanAir Do you have any sort of live chat feature? We're in the UK right now and that call would cost us alot. :(
@AmericanAir HELP NEEDED ! #complaint ticketed passenger with no available seats scheduled to leave Late Flightr today
@SouthwestAir Thanks for replying, I sen't my conf #! I love aviation and Southwest and all I wanted for my 18th was to fly SWA for the day!
@USAirways Y'all need to get it together
@JetBlue the departure time keeps getting Late Flightr.  I'll be lucky if I'm home by 3am
@united I'm sure you will offer me nothing for the inconvenience you have put me through TWICE this month. Tweets don't cut it
@JetBlue BOS to DCA 1098 at 7:16 pm.
@USAirways also your employees were LESS then helpful when @Jack_Kairys was checking his bag. Two just left their desks completely (1/2)
.@AmericanAir @Kaha58 Would be nice if you could actually talk to the reserv. team...it just hangs up on you and has been since last night.
@SouthwestAir greetings
@united Thank you so much for your help with my birthday trip! Tickets are confirmed! :-)
@VirginAmerica When will VX use all 6 LGA slots instead of 4 today? Adding AUS makes this less likely :(
@USAirways been on hold for over an hour, still don't know where my bags are, won't refund me my flight?!?! It wasn't weather!!
@USAirways technical issues = inefficient computer triage system. Personality/ compassion of operators = not. Sad example of sad company.
@AmericanAir 901 #Miami to #Rio to participate at @RCM_Oficial representing @CisnerosMedia #yourstoryhere
@USAirways, can't control weather/flight attendant.Can control this-green ACU bag, 1.5 hrs &amp; counting! Yep that's me! http://t.co/0jUtCDRLjl
@AmericanAir flight 3056 still sitting at DFW waiting for baggage to be loaded
@united #1007 Houston-Bogota boarding again, safety first, it seems the mechanics fixed the problem faster, good energy to fly home/family
@JetBlue a voucher.. I can't believe I took this risk. Not only was the plane terribly filthy and I had 15 screaming babies in my face..
@USAirways Its pretty ridiculous that at PHX sky harbor you have 4 (!) employees working check in on a SUNDAY afternoon. 30 min &amp; counting..
@JetBlue That'd be nice! Hoping to rack up enough miles to take a trip to Seattle and enjoy a perfect latte in the city of coffee.
@SouthwestAir have five people shown up yet
@JetBlue 2nd time flying jetblue this year and my armrest TV controller doesn't work agian!!and that's the main reason I fly jetblue üòîüòìüò§
@united wanted to point out that not one United crew has been sympathetic. Questions unanswered. MileagePlus is starting to look like a joke
@USAirways Literally all that says is "Case open"  What good is that to me?
@SouthwestAir- Wife's RR pts expired a few days ago, were planning on Flight Booking Problems trip today. Anything you can do for us? On a tight budget...
@VirginAmerica spending my birthday night with you, DAL-DCA. Get me home!
@AmericanAir She got to the gate just in time to watch the plane push back. 5 minutes was all she needed. Glad we‚Äôve relatives nearby.
@USAirways  I'm glad this airline is going to be swallowed by American!!! American always picks up the phone and solves problems.
@SouthwestAir delay is understandable but look at the time of the the flight and boarding time. Weird!
@united I'm confused. After your @Dulles_Airport agents directed us to go to your website after DELAYS nothing works! http://t.co/cypRHe5GOK
@VirginAmerica Nice, Lofty View @flyLAXairport. #SilverStatus http://t.co/F4Tp0dAwbd
@AmericanAir I purchased Main Cabin XT for f-1571AUS. Flight was Cancelled Flightled and I was rescheduled on 1600 with regular seats. Credit?
@SouthwestAir could u put one here in Baltimore? http://t.co/vLCI2KV1IP
@JetBlue your customer services agent Jorge at Orlando International is rude and disrespectful, I never want to deal with your bullshit ever
@United Airlines Is Changing Its MileagePlus Program: Winners And Losers http://t.co/F1yvAiO9ul http://t.co/vGlx6Ykwqg
@united what a nightmare!!  Both sides of my flights are a disaster!  At Houston getting attitude cuz I was sent to ticket counter
@SouthwestAir RUDE gate agent. Wholly unacceptable to us &amp; other passengers. Think this will be our last time on sw.
@united What is the point of a UPC code on checked baggage if you can't tell me where my luggage is? Vacation- day 3: trying on swimsuits...
@AmericanAir what kind if airlines do you guys run? The people that got in line first received hotel vouchers? Terrible customer service!
@JetBlue not making a great first impression on my first flight. 20 minutes before boarding and the gate agent still can't assign me a seat?
@united is the worst. Worst reservation policies. Worst costumer service. Worst worst worst. Congrats, @Delta you're not that bad!
@VirginAmerica Are there any sign up bonuses to enroll in Elevate?
@united i would like to know if its possiable to checkin online or must it be done at Schiphol?
@USAirways @AmericanAir did I mention I'm a silver preferred member and fly every week (not always with you), and not even a meal voucher?
@AmericanAir everything for sorted out. Thanks for the help. Excited to get home tonight!
@USAirways ... I f@$%ing hate you.
@AmericanAir I understand flight Cancelled Flightation but not being able to get through to change that flight for 6 hrs is not acceptable.
@AmericanAir flights out of Dallas on Tuesday are not going to be Cancelled Flightled correct?
@united My credit card was charged on the transaction when I was told it would not be. If the charge goes through I will be contacting you.
@SouthwestAir #fail  southwest changes my flight to a different time and city and blames it on me. They won't correct it. #furious
@united UA938 ORD-LHR.  bags are being loaded 30min Late Flight. Frigid air into cabin! Plane feels like falling apart! Upgrade long haul fleet!
@VirginAmerica currently in minute 10 of being on hold with cust. service. Do I need to do anything to add a lap child to my reservation?
@united it just goes round &amp; round, it's be going on for weeks,
@united DEN-PHX flight tomorrow Cancelled Flighted. Asked for overnight 2nite in LAX/SNA. Told not without paying. That's wrong
@USAirways will you please start offering more routes out of @triflight to more locations instead of just charlotte and atlanta
@USAirways I didn't make a reservation yet. It's about changing name on my dividend miles account
@USAirways still can't get a real person on the phone to book a flight. Ready to just go with #jetblue since they care. #usairwayssucks
@united go to hell
@AmericanAir is there another line I can call when I am on hold for 5 hours? Also how can I get compensated for this loss of time and money?
@AmericanAir Considering it was purchased on the 21st and I attempted to use it again on the 21st I believe it would fit these parameters.
@USAirways "Able"? Does that mean not having private conversations and not helping those w/ luggage that won't fit overhead?
@SouthwestAir @love_dragonss LAUREN IM SCREAKJMF
@SouthwestAir props to your LAS employees working C11 gate. Because of them I am not opposed to flying through or to LAS in the future! üëèüëèüëè
@USAirways my flight was Cancelled Flightled yesterday and moved to today, then while at my stop in DC my flight is delayed due to lack of crew US4485
@united #787 to begin Newark-London Heathrow route on May 6 @PANYNJ @BoeingAirplanes @FroschTravel http://t.co/RdJ1MwFLg1
@JetBlue thanks JB!! This is why I üíô you!
@united Read my bio. See who I work with. I have NEVER encountered this with your airline before. Disappointed is an understatement.
@AmericanAir spoke too soon. 30 min Late Flightr still waiting for bags to load. Some sympathy would be appreciated at the very least.
@SouthwestAir Luvin me some flights today!! Don't change!!  And please add Paypal as payment option!!!
@AmericanAir Connection is US2065
@AmericanAir Thank you for the response.  When I book I've tried my AA number and my US Airways number and each time it doesn't pick it up
@SouthwestAir I've been on hold for over an hour and counting‚Ä¶just need a simple name change http://t.co/5Siczx1oez
@SouthwestAir My flight to KC has been Cancelled Flighted and the next available isn't till Tuesday?! What am I supposed to do for 3 nights?????
@SouthwestAir your hold music sounds like it's from Super Mario Bros for gameboy color
@AmericanAir why am I continually getting put on hold by painfully inexperienced people when calling your Platinum desk?!
@USAirways thanks for getting me rescheduled on a direct flight to NOLA tonight in 10 minutes--and hopefully an hour earlier getting there!
@AmericanAir I understand weather is not your fault but ur cs reps are atrocious. I am NOT happy nor will I EVR fly w/ u again.
@JetBlue I knew there was a reason u were my favorite airline. Just read you answer on twitter in globe this morning. Great job
@SouthwestAir iiiii need help with my flight schedule!!! haha
@JetBlue Got flight reschedule to flight form PIT to FLL and our flight had mechanical problems so we were delayed an hour Missed my connect
@united already missed  connection ugh
@SouthwestAir Nashville airport has runways open. It appears southwest is only airline Cancelled Flighting flights. Is this likely to change?
@AmericanAir usually raving about the service to LAX. Your nbr1 and helper can't figure out how to hang a coat and serve a drink. 6F
@AmericanAir Could have voided the ticket since it was &gt; 24hrs since Flight Booking Problems. Are you going to waive the fees? Still can't get through.
@united @nathankillam or your staff could try not throwing the luggage around.
@united three delayed flights and missed connections on first class flights and not get any compensation for losing those seats...
@AmericanAir more of the insane treatment by your customers
@JetBlue @courteroy LOLZ. "On Fleek"
@united thats because you didnt read my entire tweet. Wife's 12pm flight is now delayed to 6:30.  Thats 3 6+ hour flight delays in 2 weeks
@USAirways citizen. I fly your airline constantly and am so offended.  Derrick Bussey. Now Im crying on this airplane because I'm so upset
@united Thank you. Yes, I was hoping to speak with someone directly, but appreciate the link nonetheless. :)
@southwestair I have a roundtrip ticket now and I need to change one leg of the trip (to a nearby airport) - not possible via website?
@united the incompetence is truly stunning at this point. 4 hours on a plane for a 1.75 hour nonstop flight.
@USAirways I will never fly @USAirways again
@JetBlue Only middle seats. SFO -&gt; BOS. Not fun. She keeps getting $10 credits. Would much rather have a working TV.
@AmericanAir Why does your iPhone app not have any sort of notifications option?
@USAirways is the @comcast of airlines #2hrs35minOnHold
@USAirways US airways csr at Phoenix airport fixed the problem
@SouthwestAir Do you have childrens rates for flights?
@AmericanAir and then wanted to change it to BA for Avios.
@JetBlue to End Partnership with American Express - http://t.co/WhuFmI2Ytd http://t.co/fbTEMFwRsP
@SouthwestAir kudos to the #RSW CS crew for re-routing PAX to alleviate Over sale due to down graded EQP 800 now 500
@SouthwestAir too bad I'm getting this memo: "Your reservation contains modifications that prevent you from changing it online." #FUSTURATED
@usairways that wasn't the issue. Someone finally helped on the phone. Now theres a website error that won't let me process my request. SMH
@SouthwestAir I would appreciate that.  Thank you.
@USAirways I tried reaching out to you guys I'm running out time and patience I just want my flight to be honor and I want a confirmation!
@JetBlue shows us their sense of humor with these tongue-in-cheek flight etiquette videos: http://t.co/GGuAA1JvDF
‚Äú@JetBlue: @Analystdoc Unfortunately that's not an available option with our current system. Sorry guys. That's a certain #fail Fix it plz.
@united so you are saying that customer care does not report to anyone? Their response is humiliating for a company that serves the public.
@united 25 minute hold is 1 hr. 25 min. @ABC11_WTVD
@SouthwestAir Totally ruined my birthday weekend by Cancelled Flighting my flights for no reason and offer no points, drink, transport. #nolove #cali
@USAirways why let passengers on board when there was an issue? Over an hour &amp; the pilot doesn't know when we'll leave.
@AmericanAir what's the status of flights for Tuesday out of Dallas??
@USAirways Handled. I found tkt on floor dropped by someone. No way - I‚Äôm in wheelchair - to get to podium.
@USAirways question, friend flight got Cancelled Flightled. How can he book be flight? Leaving CHS to Philly to Germany
.@AmericanAir Hopefully it's all fixed. They've got a new aircraft for us- just waiting to board.
@USAirways i hate you
@AmericanAir Oh that seems to have undone the seat selections in MCE. We only wanted the CX card on there to select the free seats
@SouthwestAir Is your BWI-SJD service seasonal? Wasn't part of extension. Called intl desk. They didn't know. Want to fly in Sept on Sat.
@JetBlue @L_Burley11 -- the best!!!
@SouthwestAir Southwest is scheduled to fly to Costa Rica on March 7 but I can't book it online. When will this be available?

@SouthwestAir still no update text #2053 &amp; still no response to email fr1/5/2015 SR #256746438028. Feel like yr losing customer service/care
@AmericanAir Are there any travel advisories for Toronto, ON today? I can't access anything regarding international travel on your website--
@USAirways worst customer service. Still not providing me an answer even after I drove back to CLT airport. been rude &amp; unacceptable #fail
@united Why did you load us in this flying sardine can if you knew the pilots were 2 hours Late Flight?? #incompetent beyond belief
@USAirways just heard #Monterey airport was closed due to thick fog, any updates
@SouthwestAir   I hate evolved seating. knees in the seat pocket http://t.co/forNpF69Ky
@united was trying to change a flight online but got an error can you help via DM?
@AmericanAir why would I even consider continuing your point program when I received no perks or continued bad customer service? #senseless
@united we needed them here asap. Will they make it on today's flight?
@AmericanAir lies,lies,lies.  Worst travel experience of my life. Day 2 no clothes on vaca.  #lostluggage #unprofessional #pit #mia
@united Just got interrogated at the United Club Chicago. #UnitedAirlines #rude #PoorForm
@USAirways even if I was the single most unreasonable human being on planet earth, there is no excuse for his treatment of me.
@JetBlue what's the delay if the system isn't down?
@USAirways I left my personal stuff on US4551 from PHL-BOS about an hour ago. Went baggage, was told plane left to call 800#
@united don't need your apologies, need my bag. Took 56 minutes from landing to get it. Unacceptable.
@USAirways @AmericanAir any help regarding flights out of KPHL would be much appreciated
@AmericanAir #AmericanViewThe view of Oregon from seat 31F, flight AA1469 2/22/15 http://t.co/t9JBN9WZtq
@JetBlue *fights air*
@united 3 phone reps. None could see I was rebooked so missed that flight.Told to go standby for a nonexistent Late Flightr flight. Did I hurt you?
@SouthwestAir when are you opening the flights beyond august 7th???
@United flight experiences R often frustrating, but 2day on UA5184 from CHI to WPG flight attendant April was #amazing! She's 1 of the best!
@SouthwestAir then had to watch the staff check off each passenger on the list TWICE, because the first time they forgot look at IDs. Brutal
@united I haven't booked yet, I'm asking before I book
@JetBlue your agents at IAD have compounded this problem by not making any announcements #jetbluemess
@AmericanAir DM sent
@SouthwestAir @HDsportsguy yes I did. I hope for an update soon, need those clothes for a meeting tomorrow.
@VirginAmerica will you be making BOS&gt;LAS non stop permanently anytime soon?
@USAirways I can't wait for the @nytimes and @WSJ to find out how poorly @USAirways handled this situation. #shameful http://t.co/HHOxQPsUbA
@JetBlue bag is supposedly here in Boston
@SouthwestAir why does the customer service have rather inconsistent information
@united I hadn't filed a refund claim as I was told there was no charge by your DM. This is disputed by my bank, hence why I would like(1/2)
@JetBlue got it. Thanks
@SouthwestAir Unable to check in my flight. It says my itinerary is ineligible for checkin online. Go to counter. Very inconvenient!!!
@SouthwestAir really shouldn't offer sweeps if your link isn't going to work! B http://t.co/nOfG0TQHYN
@USAirways @AmericanAir how do I get thru on hold over 3 hours ?
@JetBlue I may not make my connection and need to find out my options, yet no one is here.
@AmericanAir Flight  AA1691 LAX to LAS closes too early and gate agents give us hassles #PatheticCX
@AmericanAir @yvonneokaka When do I get my personal response and apology for your crew's having forgotten to load baggage onto my flight?
@AmericanAir We've 15 official complaints signed by #AmericanAirlines Lima supervisor. Customer Relations pls compensate 4 the 10-hour delay
@JetBlue What a great idea! #cometoAustin
@JetBlue Great Thank you, lets hope so! Could you please notify me if flight 2302 leaves JFK? Thank you again
@united can you you think about hiring some baggage attendants at EWR? Been waiting for bags for 1 hr. United = overcharged&amp;underserved
@united Checking tracing information. You got 2 numbers wrong in my phone number &amp; how did a turquoise duffle bag become a black laptop bag?
@AmericanAir I am looking for help on USAirways award travel booked for wife and two boys, no seats assigned.
@USAirways my sister was supposed to leave at 10 am to go back to AL. She's only getting to NC now. Are you kidding me #NeverflyUSairways üëø
@united we've been here since 3am and you've Cancelled Flightled our flight twice
@united can I get on a stand by list from ASE to ORD? I'm the only poor person in Aspen, that's why I'm asking for standby on twitter.
@JetBlue I'll see you on board again soon!
First base already? I like your style @JetBlue
@AmericanAir thanks
@AmericanAir  I was told it would be emailed to me, but I haven't received anything yet. How can I follow-up?
@AmericanAir @Active_Aly thx. We have already been on the iberia website, and seat reservation is unavailable. Hopefully we can call them.
@united you have Cancelled Flightled my flight UA922 for aircrft maintenance. I'm delayed 10 hours now. What's my refund options?
@USAirways are people going to answer our calls?
@USAirways I don't know I've tried to call for confirmation but calls aren't going thru. Can you let me know?
@united I can't even look at you right now. I'll call you when I'm not so mad.
No no no bad airline bad! *bops you with newspaper* ‚Äú@JetBlue: @maatkare67 We hope you're still our bae! @TatianaKing @thewayoftheid‚Äù
@USAirways flight 1783 CLT to BOS
@united Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry-on was apparently taken off &amp; left in Chicago. Pretty ridiculous.
@AmericanAir its not that, it's the rude agent who wouldn't listen to anything I would say and it clearly fit into the sizer
@AmericanAir You should be apologizing for your rude sales reps and failure to offer anything other than trite, condescending platitudes....
@united on line baggage system complete rubbish. bag missing 2 days. No meaningful information.
@USAirways Only the JFK baggage office is open to help re-book all of us on Cancelled Flightled flight 3121 to DCA. Shameful.
@AmericanAir Howdy, having trouble getting rebooked after flight Cancelled Flightled. Can't get thru via phone and Web erroring out. Can you help?
@VirginAmerica already contacted Central Baggage &amp; sent DM. @RenttheRunway is charging me for the dress that was in the lost suitcase #help
@united We've let you know how to help the millions of customers you've treated like garbage. It's no coincidence ur ranked WORST airline.
@USAirways sorry I didn't realize I wasn't following you
@usairways #crew keeping safety top of mind in CLT. http://t.co/a0YoSJHZMc
@united flight 403 is delayed 40 min bc a missing screw and were in danger of missing flight 6491
@SouthwestAir do you do auto callbacks so I don't have to wait on hold?
@SouthwestAir I am going to stop flying with you.  Delays everytime.  This time due to paperwork?
@united I have tried and you have failed. Still no wifi ever, last row in the middle and I fly every week. Thanks for nothing.
@united to be clear on my luggage comment, I am referencing the photo attached. Flight 6232 to JAC http://t.co/PnBajfkmHG
@USAirways well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on.
@united do u serve peanuts/nuts on yr flights yr policies r confusing contradictory advice Pls help #Anaphylaxis,will u ask those 2 refrain?
@united you are making me miss big snow in Montana. Not cool.
@united Stuck in Houston because you can't seem to get a plane to the destination on time in perfect flying conditions.
@USAirways Was just on hold with you all for TWO HOURS and then got hung up on. oh my god.

@AmericanAir I slept in the miami airport due to mechanical issues and was given 10,000 bonus miles to try and make it right. #slapintheface
@united You make it hard to fly with you. Delayed over an hour and now the plane  is turning around &amp; heading back to the gate. #connection?
@VirginAmericawjere is our luggage #so slow at lax
@AmericanAir how can I when system always hangs up on me?
@SouthwestAir Was on hold for 2 hours before you disconnected me after my flight was Cancelled Flightled. Swell company, you.
.@AmericanAir Advised GAs and pilot of my flight. Too bad no one took action.
@AmericanAir waited in the airport for two days to get home, not weather reLate Flightd. Dealt with horrible customer service. Finally switched to
@SouthwestAir what's up with these delays?! Throw some priority boarding my way &amp; I'll forgive you!! üëç #southwest #southwestairlines
@SouthwestAir Totally sucks that my flights were weathered out of existence, but Stacy in Tucson helped with an overnight in Vegas!
@SouthwestAir Im just praying you get me home alive
@united I did. It took about an hour and a half though
@SouthwestAir please help me get tickets to the @Imaginedragons club show in Atlanta?! #DestinationDragons
@AmericanAir thank you for replying. Trying to figure out how to get from there from DFW
@AmericanAir what's the status of flight 1357 out of sju?
@AmericanAir I love very much your planes, can you please follow me back? It's an amazing bussines!
@SouthwestAir No one wants to commit to saying if this plane is getting Cancelled Flighted or not. Customer relations is closed. Patience gone.
.@SouthwestAir I will if you can see about moving up my Brother in laws graduation to the 6th.  Thanks.
@djevolutionhd As an EP who travels 125K+ miles a yr with @AmericanAir , I would expect more from them than this horrible travel experience
@united I am on 1528 and my connecting flight is 909
@JetBlue who do you think is gonna win Mayweather or Pacquiao?
@JetBlue thanks for getting us to NYC -JFK really safely. :-) But srsly? How long does it take to get our checked bags? #eternity #5amMisery
@USAirways : Was on flight 2046 BOS-CLT on 2/22, awful experience, exit row seat was so narrow that I could not move my legs! Unacceptable.
@scm1133 @USAirways we hate delays!! have you tried any of these?! http://t.co/7STktJXAN1 (although we're not sure what a timbit is...)
@AmericanAir You guys did an amazing job today! Know it‚Äôs hard; thanks to Kate Appleton for all her hard work reFlight Booking Problems my friends and me!
@AmericanAir seriously, all flights from Detroit to Dallas are Cancelled Flightled 2 days in a row. I want to get home &amp; see my wife &amp; kids.
@AmericanAir can someone actually either call back or help me figure out how I'm getting home??!
@united yes it is partly used, the del-ewr is used, the return flight was Cancelled Flightled due to technical glitch in operations
@AmericanAir I was happy to purchase the upgrade. If only it was avail on my next flight.
@AmericanAir requested a call back at 1am. My Cancelled Flighted flight through DFW shouldn't take this long to reroute. You're Customer Service lacks
@united Did you get your 757 Model?
@united It is also inappropriate to lie to passengers to induce them into accepting a voucher by telling them you have availability on Late Flightr
‚Äú@AmericanAir: @Dumas2TTG Good morning, Tamara. We'll try to get you comfortably on a flight as soon as we can.‚Äù#NoXTraLegRoom #NoCoatCloset
@AmericanAir a friend is having flight Cancelled Flightlations out of LAX to CMH on Feb 23. Anyway to help her? 800 number has been no help
@USAirways it's not a consolation because my bags are somewhere else, which is a real impediment to me going on a different vacation
@americanair flight veers off icy runway at @dfwairport. Most DFW flights Cancelled Flighted Monday, Flightaware says. http://t.co/atwyiFh6Zy

@united I didn't have time to take my wet clothes/suit back to the airport and wasn't going to pay for another cab to do so.
@SouthwestAir #flight #Cancelled Flightled...tried to get refund but on hold. Can I get it after my flight would have departed?
@SouthwestAir your customer service is terrible, you're terrible, thought you should know.
@USAirways No hot food on a 5 hour flight? Crazy. Couldn't eat in PHL b/c our original connection was 40 min Late Flight. What gives? #PHLtoLAS
@united I am so happy I found my phone because this is easily the worst system I have ever heard of
@united now finally in memphis. Landed 30 minutes ago. Still no bags. Paying for a service that just gets worse...
@USAirways what are the odds you can get me on a flight with delta so I can actually get to Orlando today?? #2daysLate Flight
@united my fingers are crossed that they are more capable of getting baggage from point A-&gt;B than United Airlines!
@USAirways please fix your reservations phone system.  The weather/backup could not possibly be bad for 10 days!  #goodgriefpeople
@united @ShulemStern @gg8929 Raise a dispute with your cc provider and they will hopefully clear it for you.
@USAirways who do we voice our concerns to when we can't get home with our 8 month old after waiting to taxi to a gate for 3 hours?
@SouthwestAir finally!
@JetBlue understand that, but this policy of targeting your passengers is not good for business and should be addressed with security
@AmericanAir understand the weather but would be nice to hear an apology on the phone when you moved my flight to an inconvenient day
@JetBlue now we dont have enough money for parking in your garage this is your fault and im not paying for what should be 10mins into 3hrs
@SouthwestAir Flight to Nashville was Cancelled Flightled. How do we another flight? I've been trying to call &amp; cannot get a human
@AmericanAir hats off to Admiral Lounge attendant @ YYZ Terminal 3 who gave her banana to our toddler when none avail elsewhere.
@USAirways can I bring mini bottles of booze on to my flight?
@united not the case. Now delayed due to "mechanical issues with no update on departure time". Just Cancelled Flight the goddamn flight so I go delta
@VirginAmerica @FiDiFamilies us too! Terrible airline! Just gave us a hotel hotline number and said sorry
@AmericanAir These birds could fly to South America for example #Argentina
@USAirways we're glad to hear it. Out of curiosity, what causes such flight patterns?
@USAirways your service in Philly is unacceptable. Look into better service‚úåÔ∏è a 16 yr old shouldnt have a hard time http://t.co/WDAKTmr7Mj

@USAirways @AmericanAir been with US Airways since 03,  back and forth Gatwick - Charlotte, then LHR. Bit sad nostalgic way.
@SouthwestAir Is there any way to add a Known Traveler Number to an existing reservation online?  If not, why not?
@JetBlue I waited 3 hrs for my bags and my flight was only 2 hrs
@SouthwestAir Way to go flying out of Denver today! Must be the only airline not Cancelled Flighting/delaying flights! #FlySWA #denverairport

@SouthwestAir Landed in Nashville! Thanks for taking care of us! http://t.co/RYXbPLgMnK
@JetBlue Why doesn't your "Best Fare Finder" work?
@JetBlue true. Maybe. Wish I had expedited security haha
@AmericanAir no apologies required. I made it home safe thanks to you! Kudos to AA!
@JetBlue this feels nice - what we've got going on here. Let's just swap me out with the fool in 5a and we can make it all better.
@SouthwestAir officially on hold for 2 hours!
@AmericanAir I can't get through to a customer rep to help me out. This is the only option I have got.
@SouthwestAir's CEO Kelly draws record crowd to @BWI_Airport Business Partnership breakfast http://t.co/hrvuKtpvn1 http://t.co/MY3dnVBZAZ
@united The agent that met us at the gate said any issues w/delays on UA1116 would have to be taken up online...
@JetBlue Just a thought!
‚Äú@USAirways: @alan_bledsoe Thanks for your feedback, Alan.‚Äù Thx, but  no help as I watch a flt Lve w/open seats and I wait 3hrs for nxt flt
@AmericanAir I have an issue that requires a bit more than a tweet to explain, do y‚Äôall have an email?

@SouthwestAir thanks for the response - flight time has passed - rebooked now

@AmericanAir Why did  AA973 return to JFK? Thanks :)
@united what time should I arrive at the airport for my 6:15 am domestic flight out of San Diego?
@united No customer service rep could confirm where my bag was &amp; each gave me different info. Ruined 2 events I had today. #disappointed

@SouthwestAir @love_dragonss LAUREN OMG IM DEAD IM SO SO HAPPY FOR YOU YES YES

@united @retailbagholder hahaha. At least they gave u a refund.
@USAirways the Late Flightr flight to Charleston is leaving before the flight scheduled earlier.  That's so wrong
@USAirways you need to check information regarding hotels, shuttles, re routing flights, delayed flights
@united so unhelpful... http://t.co/vBfIeo2qJC
@united I see you tweeting as little as 7 min ago. Are you just ignoring my CS request? #CantLogOutOfUnitedWifi
@VirginAmerica got a flight (we were told) for 4:50 today..,checked my email and its for 4;50 TOMORROW. This is unacceptable.
@AmericanAir thanks, but I had to hire a car in Chicago and drive to MKE. Does that mean I have to go to the airport?????
@VirginAmerica Your chat support is not working on your site: http://t.co/vhp2GtDWPk
@SouthwestAir do you know that your lost baggage portal http://t.co/hUcLXluV5h doesn't work on mobile? It's a 404 http://t.co/O4ZR27Qpcr
@USAirways now you don't know where my luggage is?  Seriously?
@AmericanAir it's not just frustrating--it was PAID for! how do we get a refund?
@united Morning! 4603 has been delayed by 7 hours. Can you get me to Newark for my 10am meeting?
@AmericanAir ok so why is it Late Flight? And for that matter why was my flight 4491 Cancelled Flighted this morning? I've been in YYZ since 5 AM.
@united Booked 11 tix 1 month ago and now its about $157 CHEAPER and customer service was useless. What's up with that???
@SouthwestAir#4569 Cancelled Flightled, had to get refund. Cancelled Flightlations happen. But the 25+ min phone wait &amp; painful music unacceptable. Come on...
@VirginAmerica ‚Äã is flying from Love to Austin now. That is most excellent news.
@USAirways please respond to me. I've been on hold on the reservations line for an hour and 45 minutes. I would really appreciate it.
@JetBlue now we are waiting over an half hr for the packages. What's wrong with you guys?? http://t.co/wVGpp3Ymz1
@united is ridiculous! UA6 delayed for 3.5 hours and counting. Should have booked with a diff airline that takes it seriously #unitedsucks
@USAirways on 5:55 flight to CTL to catch 8pm flight to sfo. But empty seats on 4:15 flight which wasn't offered.  Awful service continues.

@AmericanAir @British_Airways trying to speak with an agent about my flight to London tonight but can't get anyone from AA.  Can you help?
@SouthwestAir Did yall get rid of the Austin to Cabo flights all together? There's zero non-stop in Aug and Sept
@AmericanAir The point of the pic: If your reps struggle with the merger this much, imagine how it is for the public! http://t.co/hQdB5IRuVg
@SouthwestAir Supposed to take off almost 2 hours ago....#vacationfail #frozenwater? #gettingimpatient #theycouldatleastofferfreebooze
@SouthwestAir - did SWA send out customer surveys to earn $100 toward flights? Is this legit?
@USAirways I need an actual person in customer relations for a refund. What # can I call? I will dispute this charge on my credit card.
@SouthwestAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight to BNA. I have flight from BNA 2 MDW tomorrow AM. You stranded me in DEN. I've been on hold all day
@SouthwestAir it'd be nice if I could get an answer, even a simple "no" would do; I just want to know. :)
@united i sure will
@JetBlue it's ridiculous that I just got home and I was supposed to land 3 hours ago bc I am HELLA tired
@united iCloud it is not there yet -- PLEASE HELP 917 703 1472
@VirginAmerica achieves a second year of profitability despite revenue pressure ... - @CAPA_Aviation http://t.co/zSuZTNAIJq
@USAirways just lost a faithful customer.
@united called back and I've been on hold. What is the issue?! I have a confirmation number and an email that shows how much I've paid
@USAirways glad people can put their coats in the storage area though. It would be super unfortunate to leave those on the floor
@United site errored out at last step of changing award. Now can't even pull up reservation. 60 minute wait time.  Thanks @United!
@AmericanAir @lpalumbo what weather sun is out
@AmericanAir the customer service today is unsat, Flight cnx, not notified, called for 6 hours and the phone line does not even let me hold
@USAirways I've been on hold for 40 minutes just to get a receipt. I know you guys are busy but I think it's time to higher more staff!
@SouthwestAir quick question: let's say I book a flight (I did so) and you then drop the price. Do I get the cheaper rate?
@united I honestly couldn't tell you. All I know is that originally we were going to have it brought in from the concourse
@united completed form but doubt it's any use. UA doesn't care. 6 day vacation will now be 5. Sure UA won't feel responsibility for that...
@AmericanAir awesome. Thanks!
@SouthwestAir  Thank you.
@united I will be patient as your agent explains how you have me booked on a new flight for 6:18 when that plane doesn't arrive until 6:07
@SouthwestAir give this guy a raise....great start to flight from AZ to MKE..
@united Unfortunately had a bad experience flying with you on Saturday. Inpolite crew, bad delays.
@AmericanAir found out my flight tomorrow was Cancelled Flightled &amp; got in the queue for a callback 3.5 hours ago‚Ä¶still nothing. Can I get rebooked??
@JetBlue Hopefully next time! Can I send you my future itineraries so the next one can be planned when I'm there? üòÇüòÇ
@united flight UA3364 been sitting on tarmac for 30 mins with no report as to why...any input?
@AmericanAir but seriously if my cats dead I'm going to be pissed/very thankful because it is evil and wants my soul
@USAirways 'preciate it but cant get off plane to speak w agent / wont come on plane 5015 knoxville...?
@SouthwestAir think you need to follow me for a DM
@SouthwestAir well, it was fun while it lasted. Not happy about the change to redeeming reward points. Won't be loyal anymore.
@united, I don't believe that you do.. http://t.co/7z3GqEBfK2
@united You are a F&amp;$KING joke. Your customer service is woeful. If your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it!
@SouthwestAir any chance of adding LAX-&gt;JFK direct any time in the future?
@united last night we waited forever at the gate because someone from corporate dispatch FORGOT to call the crew #unfriendlyskies
@united has an United flight ever been on time. #americanisbetter
@united dropped off a luggage at IAD over 2 months ago for repair from damages haven't heard anything about it since, when do I get it back?
@United super lame that you charge $8 for tv on an international flight to the US. It isn‚Äôt 1997!
@USAirways I asked if that was SOP, and they said ‚ÄúIt is now.‚Äù But yet the other 11 flights, nothing. Is this a policy or not?
@AmericanAir why don't you take care of @Cowboycerrone flight screw ups
@AmericanAir Filled out a baggage claim over the phone last night. Check the status to discover the rep confused Arkansas for Alaska üòí
@AmericanAir WHERE IS MY BAG?!?!?!
@SouthwestAir just want the money I paid for early bird refunded. Noone seemed to be able at three different. SW should have that worked out
@USAirways please please please let my plane back to the gate so I can get off as I will miss connection due to CLT closing. 2034
@united @reccewife with the exception of everything you've asked for. Heh
@USAirways Seriously. You can't tweet and let people know that you've got customers that have been on hold for 5 HOURS??!!
@usairways 2 people working the counter at #dca? Massive lines. Poorly played. #winterstorm
@SouthwestAir  I got rebooked for tomorrow

@SouthwestAir Thanks. I'll keep checking. I'm trying to book our first Disney World vacation.
@United maybe find a different gate #ua1758
@united I have those notifications yet the staff on board say that is not accurate and they have no departure time.
@united The flight turned around for mechanical reasons on 1/30/15.  Never to fly United again as they don't check their planes properly.
@AmericanAir no vouchers 4 Cancelled Flighted flight due 2 weather. Today's issue, broken tire. No vouchers cause tire was broken by weather. #nomoAA
@JetBlue we tried. They're not at all helpful. Terrible customer service, at this airport, at least.
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/Lv9HwQDK9A‚ÄùCan't fly you anymore, we had a good run ‚úåÔ∏è
@united Can i get a refund? I would like to book on a better airline.
@united that's not good enough for all of us affected by the awful organization and timing and have now been set back
@SouthwestAir you guys rock! So easy, quick, and affordable to change my flight. #bestairlineever #neverchange
@SouthwestAir who should I contact about a missing Rapid Rewards credit?
@United "Your bag may or may not be at the airport. Unfortunately, no one at the airport is picking up the phone or responding to messages."
@SouthwestAir you are failing! Diverted, stuck and no communication! Make a decision and let us go!!!! üòûüò° flight #4229
^CB how do you know? @SouthwestAir
@united 8602947, jon at http://t.co/58tuTgli0D, thanks.
@SouthwestAir I'm going to start charging you for the consistent body pat downs. Starting to feel like a piece of meat. #punishedforflying
@united $25 United coupon to make up for broken entertainment system on a 9-hour flight, seriously? #Ridiculousness #learncustomerservice
@JetBlue I'm a trying ! But I'm tired and getting grumpy !
@JetBlue can't book a flight because of outdated, forced opt-in "Verified by Visa" nonsense. Help a girl out? I just want to get to @sxsw
@USAirways final count 3 hours 24 minutes on hold to be told I need to log in to U.S. Airways website and there was nothing else to be done
@VirginAmerica plz help me win my bid upgrade for my flight 2/27 LAX---&gt;SEA!!!  üç∑üëçüí∫‚úàÔ∏è
@AmericanAir FYI twice now I've tried the "we'll call you when someone is free" thing. Both times it called, I picked up, then it hung up.
@AmericanAir I tried to book a rwrd and was told I couldnt. Bought tix on USAir (now AA-no choice) didn't bother to + AAdv# with this svc...
@united get your act right! You just lost customers because your staff wouldn't let us take our approved carry-on on a half empty flight!
@united 5.5 hours Late Flightr I've been in transit for a total of twelve hours...please just change the plane on flight 600 this is ridiculous SFO
@SouthwestAir looks like Bellagio to me! Good luck people! See you at the show at Vinyl
@JetBlue but thank you! Love, an anxious flyer.
@AmericanAir...still waiting for a call back....attempt #9 and hour #13...can't put a hold on an online tix, we are within seven day window.
@JetBlue when your flights delayed :)))&gt;&gt;&gt;
@southwestair Cancelled Flightling flights due to winter weather is totally understandable, but it would sure be nice if you would answer your phones.
@AmericanAir i do not want to stay overnight at this airport! I have been here since 11 am this morning!
@AmericanAir still no response from AA. great job guys!
@SouthwestAir , please explain to me why every other flight to Dallas is going out today except the 6:35 pm?????
@USAirways horrible customer service, flying from Miami to Philadelphia, sent to Charlotte, now can't get out of Charlotte!
@USAirways doesn't let u do stand by on flight due to checked bag causing u to get in 5 hours Late Flightr only to get to PHL &amp; bag didn't make it
@AmericanAir My ticket was booked with AA with miles..... Sorry we sold you a ticket with a company we merged with but we can't fix it?
@USAirways Thank you for your help today.  I have been a loyal US airways customer and i appreciate your responding to my tweets.
@USAirways is anyone working today?? Anyone want to pick up a phone?
@AmericanAir Why is it ok that no-one can help me with the bag you lost on my honeymoon 3months ago, this is not responsible or professional
@VirginAmerica I'm disappointed that the agent at the designated silver status check in line @Dulles_Airport closed to assist all pasengers
@SouthwestAir I was in Nashville and I had to drive 3 and a half hours to Memphis, but I made it as the plane was loading!
@JetBlue full the six of us had to leave flight. And now have to wait a whole day to get a flight and my kids will miss school.
@JetBlue I did see that! Working on picking up a trip or two as we type.
@AmericanAir I need an answer why we can't get into Wichita Falls.
@united feeling like a true united customer stuck.on the tarmac in dc for over 2 hrs. UNITEDFAIL
@SouthwestAir just sent another 4 drink coupons....I think I have over 30 coupons now. free drinks anyone?
@AmericanAir that's the one. My original arrival time was 10:14am, after all said and done I may be there by 9:19pm central. Not impressed.
@united so is the ^JJ standing for Just Joking?  I am not finding the humor.
@SouthwestAir thank you! DMing now.
@USAirways It says to call. Before connecting, get song, dance about weather. Weather bad 3 days? Called for 2 days before. #wasteoftime
@SouthwestAir don't ever tweet me again
@JetBlue That makes sense. It sucks, though, because now I'll be stuck in the airport for 5+ hours and Late Flight to my meeting.
@AmericanAir done.
@united officially has the most inefficient boarding procedure. There is no reason it should take 45 mins to board a plane!
@JetBlue I believe it's Irina. On the flip-side, super disappointed that EatUp Cafe isn't available on this BOS --&gt; SFO flight today.
@USAirways please keep Emily at you gso airport ticketing on staff she is amazing
@SouthwestAir can u better define the "plus one smaller type" item on carry on requirements?.. small backpacks?
@JetBlue thanks!
@united Thanks!
@united oh flight was fine. my lost luggage? not so much. looks like I'll be at least a half day Late Flight to my conference in Santa Monica...
@JetBlue luggage fees? won't b flying JB again! at least #AA gives platinum pass 2 bags! tired of overchging bg herded like cattle2slaughter
@USAirways 325 minute delay - this is absurd. Feel free to provide credits... http://t.co/e09keJ9bv1
@USAirways you have the ability to switch my flight to @AmericanAir but you cannot tell me where my bags are.
@JetBlue thanks for NOT! Sending me an update that our flight was delayed 3 hours. Unbelievable!
@united is officially my favorite airline. They have created magic for me all day!!! #friendlyskies #careyon
@united is synonymous to with #rude. And #cheap. You really don't know how to value the customer
@united not sure why the people in row 7 that paid for a premium seat can't use their overhead space... http://t.co/i9s86KiHge
@AmericanAir Was told you could only refund me the cost of my original return flight (note: flight you had booked for me was more expensive)
@JetBlue yup we know, not your fault, just not ideal sittin for over an hour but as always your staff is great!
@USAirways done it! Process initiated Saturday morning.  Can't get info with website issues &amp; inadequate phone coverage.  How 2 get update??
@JetBlue your agent told us TSA didn't have a crew to get bags!
@AmericanAir you guys Cancelled Flightled my flight for today and booked me for tomorrow, so unfortunately i have rebooked. Thanks
@USAirways It wasn't weather this morning.  AWE1701 diverted back to BOS due to mechanical issues.  So far lost one of 3 days :(
@united that would help! or how about integrate it into the App so I can just "activate" it and surf...
@USAirways instead of tweeting your customers apologizing why don't you pick up your phone
@united how do you log out of wifi in flight? Don't see any option and made typo when logging in. HELP!!
@united Didn't know that buying a seat in first class was just a 'request' to sit in first class! Very Interesting.
@JetBlue the fact that #ChrisHasMadeUsBLUSH isn't trending is how you know I'm loyal ;)
@JetBlue had a great flight to Orlando from Hartford a few weeks ago! Was great to get out on time and arrive early!
@USAirways YOU ARE THE BEST!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE;)üôèüôèüôè‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏èüôèüôèüôè
@AmericanAir Unbelievable that I cannot even wait on hold to speak to a human being to resolve my issue!!!!!!!! The system simply hangs up!
@DeltaAssist now at 57 minutes waiting on Silver Elite line for someone to pick up! Help!
@JetBlue Y U NO LET ME OUT AND MAKE FUN SIZE COOKIES #stuckonaplane #sos #babyfood
@AmericanAir my mom‚Äôs flight tomorrow Cancelled Flighted w/ no notice. Phone system said callback in 2 hours and it‚Äôs been 4. I need to go to bed!
@united on final. Pls don't let my connection leave!!!Conf# NPBHD0 http://t.co/eWXwXiDTfX
Cc @DadBoner  #boldflavors ‚Äú@united: We‚Äôre bringing Bourbon St. to 35,000 ft. with bold flavors, fresh ingredients and more dining options"
@JetBlue thanks for listening. Doesn't mean I don't appreciate you!
@SouthwestAir have u seen any of the messages the past hour ?
@JetBlue For the record, that was less than a 10-minute turnaround time for the answer from the question.  JetBlue rocks!
@USAirways would love it if you could get my wife home sometime soon - she has been stuck in Orlando and now stuck in philly for too long
@united wifi wasn't working onboard.Alerted attendant re socket.You sent me to a hotel for 24 hours with 7$ Vouchers??no wifi at hotel
@SouthwestAir we are 2 mins from departure of 4125 and no announced update nor an update to on time status. Everyone just standing. #comeon
@JetBlue where's my selfie?
@united DM sent.  Thanks.
@USAirways And by the way, I'm planning it while I've Ben waiting in the line at customer service in PHX...for over an hour!
@united Designed to deter people from forgetting things or to provide more storage space? The article says the latter #unfriendlyskies
@SouthwestAir  got my bags 35 hours Late Flightr and an offer of $50 to go pick them up. Taxi costs $65 one way. Spent $200 for the inconvenience.
@AmericanAir I need to be at work tomorrow at 8am, therefore that doesn't help.  Direct message faster than calling 800 number? #Backwards
@JetBlue you've let me down. 2:15 delay at JFK because of inbound flight from Syracuse, really? #ishouldhavedriven
@SouthwestAir @jparkermastin  customer service has been very passive in their response. Disappointed. I have only flown SW but am rethinking
@USAirways Wishing we had our luggage. 2 days now. Had to pay our way from St Thomas to San Juan. Spent extra $$$ because of this mess up.
@USAirways Big fail on not having curbside baggage in Pittsburgh and you charge 30 dollars a bag!!
@USAirways How does flight 680 look? I'm hearing about Cancelled Flightled departures from @Reagan_Airport and I'm about to head into it
@AmericanAir yea no worries. I'm just going home to Denver. Not your fault, weather sucks bad.
@USAirways baggage drop at phl b/c is incredibly backed up... unacceptable service
@VirginAmerica Umm so no reason as to why this is? Is there someone different I should contact (or contact me) to get a definitive answer?
@SouthwestAir doesn't care nor does SNA agent Jacquie Plitt, rude gal bad attitude! had 2 fly @USAirways 2 CABO thx http://t.co/VbUxfPCKfa
@united how can u not have gate ready or gate agent for going on hour two
@USAirways I can legitimately say that I would have rather driven cross country than flown on US Airways.
@united typical caned response from UA, fix your crappy performing, last placed/ranked airline in this century!
@united For my Grandma Ella's 80th, she would love a birthday greeting from your flight crew! She was a stewardess for Eastern Airlines.
@USAirways why I can't book a flight to PRN through your website?
@USAirways made it! Just! Huge relief - thanks for your help!
@USAirways that link is broken. But if it's the online baggage locator, I already tried it and it gave me no useful information.
@united nice 2 see U have a sense of humor. #3hourdelay Just want 2 B home but I'll settle for that beer. Once safely in the air, of course
@SouthwestAir THANK YOU. I left my iPad on a plane, filled out a lost and found form. Yall found it and shipped it back. Thank you #flySW
@AmericanAir help http://t.co/hYrAo7A4Uu
@SouthwestAir El Paso deals....May‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üòçüåè
@SouthwestAir any word when the customer relations department will open back up?
@united not once did #US3645 leave #ORD on time this week #shameful
@SouthwestAir my Flt was delayed, scheduled to miss my connection, can I get some help? 8HH4P2
@AmericanAir  2/2 You took cost for both flights out of my bank account. Now I can't get a refund for 2 weeks? I have been a loyal customer.
@united service so far has been horrid. We wanted to end the trip on a high note. Guess that's not an option.
@AmericanAir My ex-boyfriend picks up my calls more than you do! #Cancelled Flightedflight #nocustomerservice #americanairlines #FAIL
@USAirways obviously your corporate definition of PATIENCE needs to be reviewed.#Pleasehurryup #answerphone #reschedulemyflight
@united trade show! Come by both 130 for awesome deals on #sunkist and @webbernaturals! $$ http://t.co/1L9sCWPhph
@united not even mentioning how rude the customer service was to us. As a business owner, I'd be mortified if my employees acted as yours
@SouthwestAir y'all are fast we already have our 5 winners! Congrats!!
@USAirways Just Cancelled Flight every flight I have why don't you.
@VirginAmerica got it squared away. Someone picked up as soon as I tweeted. Should have tweeted sooner. üòâ
@AmericanAir Your logo looks like 3D glasses.
@USAirways delayed depart bc ur flight attendant wasn't there. Then after landing took 3 hrs to get a gate. Now it's another he and NO bags
@USAirways is it policy to tell customers "We can't help you?" I'm sorry but this is unacceptable
@SouthwestAir your checkin system is #poor
@JetBlue we're home, you guys recovered, now we can laugh about it and the extra day in barbados. Will you open Cuba soon?
@united who authors this fiction? I just heard on radio we don't even have a jetway secured yet #UA5037 #CMH http://t.co/T78k7aBtWF
@SouthwestAir is that @MurraySawChuck
@SouthwestAir okaaaaay UGH IM 8 MIN AWAY
@AmericanAir guess that's what I get for bragging on you. I fly you by choice unlike others who fly because they don't have other options JS
@AmericanAir thanks keep me updated just hope I make either of my connections to Killeen Tx
@united already did that at the airport and 12 hrs Late Flightr its still not here! you guys are really killing me today. trying to stay positive..
@USAirways sad experience today on 4663.  Family on Southwest direct to MCO. My loyalty to USAir = not vacationing with my boys today.
@SouthwestAir   Yes. Dale at Baggage office was wonderful. But not everyone is on the same page down there... We had a 6 hour wait!
@united it's kinda funny. No worries.
@USAirways still in yuma waiting for 2702 to go. Looks like I might miss 2696 to MontereyRegionalAirport need options please
@SouthwestAir @travelportland welcome to Portland. Sun, Mt hood and Southwest. http://t.co/y3SAHVX3Zk
@SouthwestAir- is new #MKT strategy to be average like all the rest? #whathappend? RR Points Devalued- AGAIN -http://t.co/mDbDYomrs7
@USAirways No I got to Philly on Monday and got to my final destination South Carolina on Wednesday. Its not acceptable.
@SouthwestAir My birthday is during #DestinationDragons could I get tix?? http://t.co/07XhCacjax
@USAirways Never mind that you could have told the gate I was on my way - you could delay 10 mins but not 15?
@AmericanAir no hold times, just disconnections.   There is no excuse for that
@SouthwestAir Don't worry, you will! :-)
@AmericanAir leaving over 20 minutes Late Flight. No warnings or communication until we were 15 minutes Late Flight. That's called shitty customer svc
@SouthwestAir you need this song for your next commercial!  https://t.co/jU9rHZ4RQc. #SWA #love
@JetBlue = WORST. Booked in Oct. w/ email confirm &amp; NEVER INFORMED Cancelled Flightlation. Instructed "to mail written letter" http://t.co/c7Kzbvf8h8
@united can you assign seats
@JetBlue A flight delay due to pilots oversleeping is apparently an uncontrollable irregularity that is not eligible for delay compensation.
@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline w/out WiFi...and pls no 'unwind' BS.
@united we just almost had a major accident on ua3710 ... How about passing on some information to those of us waiting on plane!!!
seriously, I want to work on the JetBlue social team RT @JetBlue: @vincenzolandino http://t.co/eiGaJyzcW2
@USAirways no they dont.  I think I already said that.  No one responds.  Its an auto response.  Wait is this an auto response??????
@JetBlue your crew didn't say it was about safety. If they say that I was glad to stay ... Check the information you give to the costumers
@united u would not be able to rebook me to get home any sooner than a now 2hr delayed flight.  #linesforever #customerservice #fail #again
@USAirways  Have an agent with reservations contact me instead of asking me to waste my time by sitting on the phone for hours
@JetBlue are you ever looking for interns ?
@JetBlue is amazing. Had a short delay. They gave me $150 credit! It was literally pretty much my fault I missed the flight.
@USAirways I will NEVER fly us airways or american again and I will share this nightmare of a story to all the many others we know who fly
@USAirways I just spent 3.5 hours and got nowhere. Entire experience #epicfail
@AmericanAir already spoke to that line, unwilling to help - really poor support #hitawall
@JetBlue flight from BOS - RSW tomorrow, all i need is my wife + 3yr old to sit together, but no option when checking in.
@AmericanAir tisk tisk. Rude flight attendants yet again. I can't hang my suit up because I didn't buy first class? @Delta when will I learn
@usairways I will make sure to never use your incompetent airlines again. My luggage has been out for delivery for 24 hours.
@united thankful for great service in Newark. Seats fixed and I was seated with my daughter! Fab landing in Fort Myers!
@AmericanAir I understand that. But 14 hours Late Flightr, I still haven't heard a word! How can you plan your week with no zero information!
@AmericanAir why did flight 1636 get Cancelled Flightled? Waiting for a rep to rebook, but wondering if there will be other issues getting out.
@VirginAmerica my flight (6000) scheduled for 1pm departure still says on time but no plane at gate. Any update on how long of a delay?
@united playing hide and seek with the gate. "We can't find it, it should only be a few more minutes."
@SouthwestAir Just OH-ing a text message I received from an entitled jackass of a friend.
@AmericanAir That's ok...You may keep my $25 and lose my bag with no info, but you no longer have my trust. Bad way to handle this.
@united you guys SUCK! Another Cancelled Flighted flight! Every flight with you has an issue!
@SouthwestAir @LukeWyckoff: her name is Jane and she wanted was a call. 617-653-3040
@AmericanAir Are you expecting delays/Cancelled Flightlations at Dallas on 25/26th due to the snow? Nothing like Monday I hope!
@AmericanAir Lots of upset people, freezing terminal, and no gate agent. Kept us waiting on plane beyond allowable time length.
@JetBlue Thank you very much!
@USAirways are you fucking kidding me??? http://t.co/qjLzrYWFj2
@SouthwestAir - i needed refund on my Cancelled Flightled flights this morning and had been on hold for more than an hour X 3. what to do?
@VirginAmerica I like the customer service but a 40 min delay just for connecting passengers seems too long. VA370
@AmericanAir 235.  We made it to Seattle...
@USAirways @AmericanAir Just had to buy a "safety" ticket online. You'll refund whichever ticket(s) are unused, in full, without penalty.
@JetBlue Is it June yet? üòä
@SouthwestAir what does TSA Pre on my boarding pass mean? http://t.co/0HmmQCzkCf
@united we've been waiting 45 min for a gate at SFO... Yet so many of them are free.  Your excellence in operational efficiency is showing
@united what's with the layover in Canada from the UA125? Is that scheduled?
@AmericanAir the status on my itinerary says on request in red. What's that mean?
@USAirways you told us last night that there was a ground stop at O'Hare FOUR HOURS AFTER Obama landed, stop blaming someone else
@SouthwestAir we've been at the gate a long time. We're gonna miss our connection at MDW. Ack! http://t.co/qRXvZFrD1Z
@JetBlue Thank you!
@JetBlue the USA help line.  i accidentally booked a flight on a thursday instead of a wednesday and want to switch
@JetBlue yup 33036 feet. But no selfie.
@usairways would it kill you to not let 3,000 miles expire
@VirginAmerica nervous about my flight from DC to LAX getting Cancelled Flightled tomorrow! Just sent you a DM to help me!
@united i booked lh via ua.  However at gate they rebooked me to a Late Flightr lh flight.  Now that flight didnt earn pqd for me.  How do i get it
@USAirways if I cant get through to reservations how can they take a look? 2+ hour hold times are not reasonable in any industry!
@AmericanAir you guys fail again.. all I need to do is use my voucher for a ticket but I can't do it online #yourphonesystemsucks
@united, b4 boarding this attendant took his shoe &amp;sock off at the desk and showed other agents his foot. So gross. http://t.co/755VpYm4Mv
@united no, didn't notice I was 38A until start of boarding. Assumed I was 8E. By time boarding started, GAs had cleared standbys, full flt
@SouthwestAir because your gate attendant let someone board whose boarding pass kept reading invalid. This messed up the passenger log.
@USAirways thanks for nothing
@AmericanAir Nope. Couldn't make changes online and after 90 mins on hold and time dealing w/ the rude rep, the 24 hour window has closed.
@USAirways you guys are the worst airline I've ever dealt with.  No notifications, no keeping customers updated.  Terrible service
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/vOUUFRN4jS‚Äù YASSS JetBlue ! Tell them !
@USAirways It's 838. We boarded and we are waiting now to take off, hopefully.
@SouthwestAir filing it now. Thank you for your response.
@VirginAmerica @ladygaga @carrieunderwood All were entertaining
@JetBlue Well, I try! See you soon!! @JayVig
@AmericanAir If you are sorry, answer my claims (AA Ref#1-2990176298, 1-3001885409 and : 1-3001885409) accordingly, without using "weather"
@JetBlue I hear you and safety is #1! I think we can get to JFK though now so let's help the pilots, passengers &amp; crew get there safely!
@VirginAmerica thanks guys! Sweet route over the Rockies #airplanemodewason
@united My mom left her Kindle on flight 1544 today. Burgundy case with a light. Seat 27D. Did anyone find it?
@JetBlue thank you. We are finally at the gate.
@united I did and then she made me feel guilty because it was economy plus and I didn't pay for the extra leg room
@SouthwestAir is really gonna hear my mouth about this bag situation.
@AmericanAir online flight notification is down.
@JetBlue not ok to Cancelled Flight flight 1274 tmrw for "weather" &amp; to rebook 4 flight the next day when there is flight tmrw night. no compensation?
@USAirways I spent an hour on the phone with them and got no where at all
@USAirways it doesn't take 6 days to respond to an already open case!
@USAirways Flight Cancelled Flightled due to "weather conditions" in arrival city. Uh...I don't think so.
@VirginAmerica i would like help with some flights please.
@USAirways back in line at terminal because phone guy couldn't help.  One person in front of me 20 min wait again? http://t.co/HQHdAD7fvK
@usairways hey just letting you know you're the worst fucking service I've ever used thanks for nothing
@JetBlue No changes made. My son's pass printed on same conf #. Just mine not print after I expressed disapptment w/ JetBlue
@united yes, but still now answers. Many have not had their luggage for 3 days! Unacceptable!!
@united 's new #flierfriendly is garbage. Just had to cry to get attendant to find a place for my medical supplies with limited overhead
@AmericanAir were stuck on a plane in Dallas that's supposed to be going to Okc. There's an issue w/ the plane. Any idea on how much longer?
@JetBlue btw, Robin Hayes is speaking at next month's @USChamber aviation summit. He ought to give a shout out to his Twitter team. You rock
@united so the 4-6hrs that you told me was what? A guess?? They've apparently had the bag 20hrs now and no call.
@AmericanAir @USAirways #Boo! Wack ass terminal 6 @flyLAXairport. No food. No lounge. No Bueno!! Never again!!!
@USAirways I absolutely knew you would try to blame weather to deny us vouchers in Phoenix. Totally false, was a crew issue.
@united But they are not... lady one phone says its in tel aviv. Tel Aviv united says its in Newark. No one knows and I have nothing...
@VirginAmerica flight 404 delayed 2 hours in LA due to mechanical problems. Handle like pros but you could have tossed us a free drink.
@AmericanAir you bet make this screw up right (for once). Things I need in bag for my job and you have "grounded" me today #painandsuffering
@AmericanAir By "answering as fast as they can", you mean hanging up on every call?
@AmericanAir @dfwairport listening to all the flights taking off over my house and kicking myself for Flight Booking Problems an AM flight tomorrow. Iceday?
@SouthwestAir The pilots&amp; crew on flt 3999 and customer service professionals at baggage claim are OUTSTANDING!! Thank you!!
@united and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved.
@JetBlue why wouldn't you just credit it right to my account instead of having a separate sign on. That seems pretty ridiculous.
@AmericanAir hi how are you
@USAirways really!??
@JetBlue I flew on a flight about 3 months ago. Me and my girlfriend got away with having sex in a restroom. Is it allowed now?
@USAirways I booked a flight yesterday but didnt receive an email confirmation and I my dividends number isn't registering. Please help.
@USAirways Stuck in Philadelphia airport for 32 hours due to "maintenance". Dreading my flight back home. Disgusting.
@JetBlue okay thanks. Hope to be flying with you guys soon!
@USAirways my vacation budget was blown bc of the lack of communication from USAirways. I will never use them again or refer anyone!
@united i understand, thanks
@united has made my no fly list. Other airlines wait when connector Late Flight. Stuck in IAH.
@AmericanAir has the worst flights and customer service, this is the second time I've been Cancelled Flighted. Gotta pay for hotel and find rides now.
@unitedYou really know how to piss people off. Your Farelock option is fake!
@AmericanAir 1 ticket agent servicing at least 60 people on line. Waiting for an hour and a half and your phones hang up on people.
@JetBlue Your scheduling skills failed. The delay went from four hours to nearly six. Don't tell me you were snowbound in PBI.
@JetBlue #489. Flight #589 is departing before we even board
@USAirways Been on hold for over 5 hours! I believe I was overcharged $200 for my flight, I need an immediate explanation. HELP
@JetBlue I hope your customer service reps are as reliable/friendly as they usually are, so far you are not living up to your + rep/exper.
@AmericanAir 20 HS students from Ithaca NY stuck in Miami flts xld u won't rebook to get kids home use carrier alliance #rulesshouldbend
@united Another delayed United flight. I should not be this surprised or upset. I'm mostly disappointed I have to Cancelled Flight my trip with my dad
@AmericanAir I want the flight I have on hold. I don't want a new flight.
@SouthwestAir Thnx. Hopefully it's just on the nxt flight up. I've got 3 shows this wknd. Worst case I'll just turn my sweatshirt inside out
@SouthwestAir turned my non-stop flight between Laguardia/dal into a 1 stop in STL. WTH? I'm thinking some sorta comp is in order? REALLY?
@SouthwestAir I have a few questions about flying with my Maltese puppy. Can you DM me?
@SouthwestAir three cheers to your Denver staff. Don't know if we will get out but they're keeping us smiling. http://t.co/RX8z53M7yy

@USAirways hey guys!  Thanks for answering me and thanks for keeping me on hold for an hour on customer service at 12 pm PST!
@AmericanAir is flight 2413 to LA delayed?
@USAirways when your routing system goes down which grounds all your long haul flights you should think about a #failover plan
@SouthwestAir on hold for 45 mins. Anyone hv a connection at SW or at another airline to get from CHI n Columbus to EWR in am?
@USAirways not even on your dime and free tickets.  #worsttraveldayever
@AmericanAir Fine. Would you have them call me? I left a message, was told it would be 2 hours for a call. Haven't heard anything yet.
@SouthwestAir thanks do yall expect to be operational tomorrow out of Nashville?
@USAirways likelihood of PHL to BDL actually leaving tonight? 2 hour delay so far!
@JetBlue the big board says we aren't leaving until after 8:30 üò©
@AmericanAir as of now, will do my best to never fly w/ #AmericanAirlines ever again. Y'all have made this a day to remember.
@AmericanAir way to ruin a vacation, my brother has called all night and had multiple places in line only to get dead air on call back
@SouthwestAir 20 minutes on hold waiting is ridiculous......
@AmericanAir We tried with multiple people. I already sat on the phone for an hour and a half and got nowhere.
@JetBlue Ok. Thanks for your help.
@united bull crap.  I spent $600 on a recent trip.  That's not small change. I got 10,000 AA miles.  Would have only been 6600 UA
@AmericanAir what's done is done. Not much you can do at this point. Trip is already over.
@AmericanAir "Airport snow removal method #22..."Keep up the good work folks, this is where Cessna's become 747's! http://t.co/oUmC1LrXDN
@USAirways Thank you!
@united the child is two years old
@JetBlue Best airline name ever. Whenever I see it, I want to get on their plane to blue skies &amp; sea. (And they DELIVER on that promise)
@USAirways what is happening with flight 1701 from BOS to PHL? Daughter and her fianc√©e are stuck in BOS!
Can I put sun in my carry on? RT ‚Äú@united: @ant_kneee Right now 0 would be a heat wave, so enjoy the warmth! Can you bring some home? ^JJ‚Äù
@united  of course this morning I see a non-stop from IAH to SFO but that was not available yesterday. #UnitedHatesUsAll
@JetBlue of course !!!!
@SouthwestAir seems like you could make more money by opening up seats on a more desirable flight.
@AmericanAir I am trying to add my tsa pre check number to my reservation online and don't see an option to do that..?? #nosecuritylines
@JetBlue plan to repair its brand http://t.co/ui9M8YpzH2 via @WSJ
@USAirways @nm4agoodlife      5 hours on hold and no answer . Guess the synergy of a merger was really planned out
@AmericanAir this is pathetic customer service. Why have bag tags, barcodes and computers if your response is, "not yet located"?
@AmericanAir Pathetic answer. Just found out my bag has been sitting at LGA for 20 hours and no call from you to lmk or delivery of bag. BAD
@VirginAmerica status match program.  I applied and it's been three weeks.  Called and emailed with no response.
@united unsmiling rep. told us hotel shuttle comes "like every 15 minutes." Breezy 30 min. Late Flightr we're taking a cab. You going to reimburse?
@JetBlue @KyleJudah new stroller. The travel credit doesn't help cover the cost of a new stroller. Your crew ruined it and therefore should
@USAirways  Instead, the miles are credited to an account that i did not open-- My request to merge the accounts is denied
@USAirways come scoop
@SouthwestAir ...and how does one obtain this companion pass?
@SouthwestAir iPhone App Adds Passbook Support #Airlines #Travel http://t.co/lJzDTHD9Bv
@AmericanAir I haven't been rebooked. I called and left my number for a callback but haven't heard anything and my flight is tomorrow. :(
@VirginAmerica hi! i'm so excited about your $99 LGA-&gt;DAL deal- but i've been trying 2 book since last week &amp; the page never loads. thx!
@USAirways 2133. Flight now Cancelled Flightled. Have been rebooked on 2pm flight. If on time take off, I'll have spent 5 extra hours at DCA.
@SouthwestAir because according to the flight attendant my husband doesn't talk english, when the fact is that he understand and talks it
@united Flight has been delayed for another hour so only have 24 mins to transit at LAX... Extremely unlikely I will make it!
@AmericanAir please do something about boarding at DCA 35X. Many delays + buses to planes on tarmac despite empty gates. Disorganized mess.
@AmericanAir Joanna did a WONDERFUL job!  Thank her for me?
@USAirways you would rather a while plane get exposed to a nasty contagious virus then work wth me to get my flight changed to a Late Flightr date
@AmericanAir not only did you rebook me on the wrong day, your phone system says it can't handle the volume and hangs up on me!!!
@AmericanAir Flight Cancelled Flightled, can't go home until tomorrow. I could use dinner and a play, @AmericanAir! It's my first time in NYC.
@USAirways how much is it to check golf clubs on a flight. They might be oversized
@USAirways over an hour now and still no one at the Yuma counter
@united's in-flight promo on their TV's includes Brian Williams. Tough to edit that quickly. Not a complaint, just an observation.
@USAirways I'm traveling around the world until the end of the year. 800 numbers do me no good.
@AmericanAir you could train your flight attendants to have some manners and decency
@USAirways delayed 2 days for weather and on top I got yelled at for being Late Flight when I was not notified of the time change #WellDone
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flighting my flight today because of weather in Dallas without being charged?
@VirginAmerica how come you don't have an iPhone app? Still using and making me waste paper.
@AmericanAir and btwn gate a8 &amp; a15 I lost a diamond earring #dayjustgotWORSE! Pls have maintenance look for it!! http://t.co/UieSR3GHHO
@united that's the reply? Lol hoping that at least the new plane was maintained before the flight. üòí
@USAirways where's my apology?
@jetblue I was able to access it by using the drop down instead of clicking on the tab.
@JetBlue it seems I never received an ID, just a password.
@VirginAmerica Grand Budapest Hotel #OscarsCountdown
@united  no thanks
@USAirways @CakeNDeath Question is will he and his lady behave...
@SouthwestAir so when do we find out who won the imagine dragons contest?
@AmericanAir Just called regarding my bag, came in yesterday and no one notified more or updated the online record locator #customerservice
@AmericanAir LAX-OGG-LAX using hard earned miles and was given lousy service, faulty seats on both legs and damaged bag. Your customer care
@USAirways I recently moved and got a new license and when I booked my flight months ago I used my old license do I need to change that?
@united On a standby to Denver, which has been delayed, and a confirmed to Aspen, whose flights have been Cancelled Flighted all day. 0 confidence.
Yes but I will nvr fly w/ @USAirways I missed my con flight bc of a coffeemaker on FT1892 Couldn't see my father be4 they put him in a coma
@USAirways My wife had flight changes due to weather now she cant checkin to her return flight and it fails Is it possible usair Cancelled Flightled
@USAirways @AmericanAir WHERE IS MY BAG ?#SOS ITIS BEING LOST FOR MORE THAN 24 HOURS ! #POORCUSTUMERSERVICE
@SouthwestAir Your #Android Wi-Fi experience is terrible! $8 is a ripoff! I can't get to @NASCAR or MRN for @DISupdates #BudweiserDuels
@united good morning, any first class upgrades available for ua1619 Feb 25  rsw to ewr? I need 4 seats please
@JetBlue Hey guys, why did my last flight earn me 0 pts? http://t.co/1syWlmTZek
@AmericanAir thanks... I finally got through this afternoon.  :)
@AmericanAir @USAirways need to be reported to the @BBB_media for their complete disregard for paying customers! #DoNotFlyWithThem
@SouthwestAir wife's flight to DAL just got Cancelled Flightled. What does she do to find options to get back home?  1708 PHX-&gt;DAL
.@united Don't post a link to an article that verifies the initial complaint with 20+ comments saying the same thing. @harris
@AmericanAir terror story my luggage was delayed both ways on an international flight for over 5 days total #angrycustomer
@SouthwestAir we have to stay in Chicago overnight and meet up with our bags there. I hope they stay put and don't get put on a flight.
@JetBlue minutes to spare.
@AmericanAir why wont you find my luggage without blaming everyone else?
@united spoke to someone on your feedback line last night who said she would get me a preferred choice seat for today...
@USAirways my buddies are currently delayed 3.5 hours and counting in DCA on their ways to CAE for a golf week, any compensation? #FlyDelta
@USAirways has the WORST customer service and their flights are always delayed
@JetBlue :/ he was trying to take stuff from the under the seat in front of him and bugging out throughout the flight. Didn't feel safe.
@JetBlue why yes, yes it does!!!!  Great trip down!! Thanks for the lift!!!!
@AmericanAir no worries you're swamped I know just dmd back THANK U
@USAirways you can thank supervisor Jeanine and her coworkers for the excellent customer service they provided
@united it was such a lovely part of this long day - attendants on UA5168 (most) /UA795 were beyond exceptional today. #GiveThoseLadiesRaise
@USAirways horrible travel day w/ your airlines. My 2:20 flight to Birmingham was Cancelled Flightled w/ no notification so I couldn't get on the 4:05
@JetBlue I love flying with u, but I have a question, why is one of ur planes called ny jets
@united is flight 587 from DFW to ORD currently on-time? I see an advisory that DFW may be affected by weather
@united Made@it to the gate at 8:23 and they wouldn't let us on. http://t.co/xAToxBnsFa
@united e-ticket # 0162389030167, refund request # 16866853, case id # 8465981
@united will do. Thx. Been sitting on plane now for 2.5 hrs and now we have to refuel!  I can't even make this stuff up.
@USAirways then drop your fee! $150 ($300RT!!!!) makes no sense; most EU airlines charge $0. @AirCanada charges a reasonable $50.
@AmericanAir an hour at baggage carousel and still no luggage?? Nail in the coffin.
@JetBlue can your people working this contact me, I have a project in the works.
@SouthwestAir got mine!  Just in time for the wife and my 15th anniversary!
@usairways now on hold for an hour. So frustrating, I suspect you have more operators come in on days like this w/inclement weather?
@AmericanAir My wife &amp; infant daughter are on AA3195 ABI-DFW. En route but delayed. Can y‚Äôall hold AA1458 to RDU so they can connect?
@USAirways captain on flight 1712 from PHX-PHL at 3:55 tonight was hilarious. "Greetings from the pointy end of the airplane" haha thanks!
@SouthwestAir No I have not.
@united its 2015. How can my flight from a major city already be Cancelled Flightled 24 hours before departure due to weather??  Backup planes??
@VirginAmerica hold times at call center are a bit much
@united I did... no response back
@SouthwestAir I'm flying in a couple of weeks and I need my ticket changed from my maiden name to my married name. Pls help!
@SouthwestAir go south everyone
@united Got me home amid snow &amp; Cancelled Flightlations; delivered bag w/o hassle; plus no wait on phone &amp; an upgrade. Thank you!
@united if your air traffic crew could get their shit together no one would notice the rudeness of the ground staff
@SouthwestAir your A-list program is a complete JOKE! Your company does not value loyal customers.Time to look for another "go-to" airliner
@USAirways getting sorted, thanks
@united Do you have any flights with lie flat seating from STL to PDX around the date of March 5?
@AmericanAir why a different airport! I have no way of getting to a different airport.
@united Not fast enough.  No excuse for service between big hubs to have such outdated craft. Southwest has wifi. This is awful.
@USAirways 2 days in a row, not buying it. I suggest you review your policy w respect to unaccompanied minors, should have had a seat on Sun
@SouthwestAir That does sound hopeful. It's a very thin device so I just hope the right person found it in time.
@AmericanAir fortunately the window seat was a no-show. Able to scoot over and create space.
@united UA1469. Just landed.
@united How about free wifi when your flights delayed? Only 20 mins allowed!
@united @USAirways @AmericanAir @americanone one of you has my bag! Claim 4016688561 and i want it in MGA!!!! Now!!!
@SouthwestAir just got a call apologizing personally for the long waits last week trying to rebook flights. Class act. I appreciate that!
@USAirways an award travel ticket but cannot since it is under a different last name. I simply need to change it
@united Conference begins in 3 hours. Up all night due to delays and still waiting to talk to someone about lost luggage.
@USAirways booked flight 1mnth ago, seat CONFIRMED, small plane arrived and was not allowed to board bcs no seat, horrible service
@united 757 N33103 taxies @bhx_official departing as UA26 to Newark Liberty Airport http://t.co/IALiCEH2FT
@USAirways so I guess you are ok with people being sexually assaulted on your flights nice customer service
@AmericanAir "overweight" flight = you sold more tickets than you had seats. We all know that. Let's call it what it is.
@SouthwestAir please let those with nothing in overhead bins to exit first. Fly a lot and only bring purse. Tired of running for connection
@JetBlue 290 to Boston
@United, will you fill it? Yes they will. Thanks! #BringYourOwn, @kleankanteen http://t.co/daaa0rqBXW
@nrhodes85 isn't it funny that @USAirways just apologizes, but doesn't actually take steps 2 go above &amp; beyond for customers? #NotImpressed
@SouthwestAir where are our pilots? Plane is here flight says it's still on time, but we should of been off the ground 15 minutes ago.
@united Thank you for the Delta transfer. Will my bags go too?
@AmericanAir yes starting w/ flight 1278, getting me home more than 48 hours Late Flightr. record locator BSUXLU

@AmericanAir @Clarkey_19 we done it with 1 truck... No biggie üòÑ
@SouthwestAir @BrittanyOBX11, keeping families apart w/ your quirky, archaic policies. Any other airline accommodates in this situation.
@JetBlue where is it coming from? I thought Tampa?
@AmericanAir are flights from Columbus Ohio to Dallas Texas Cancelled Flighted?
@AmericanAir @karabuxthomps Yeah, I have a lot of questions, number one: how dare you
@AmericanAir thanks for the response. I know it's not your fault... But Im in ORD in T5 and hungry if you want to stop by ‚úàÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏è
@AmericanAir maybe you should stop tweeting and start calling. Or make it available for people to wait on-hold instead of hanging up on us.
@united @staralliance Now do the right thing and reinstate the tickets you voided #UnitedFail
@SouthwestAir where your airline people screwed up our boarding passes on the way back from puerto Vallarta. This is horrible and we are
@AmericanAir my flight 386 to Dallas from Jacksonville fl has been Cancelled Flightled. No one has notified me. What's going on?
@SouthwestAir everything OK? This is my 3rd call for the day and this time I've been on hold for 1.5 hrs. I'll hang up and try again.
@USAirways look @Delta has made the right call on CHO. Please evaluate. http://t.co/3KhGjoFgpX
@AmericanAir  Yes I do bit you don't follow me so I can't DM you
@SouthwestAir can you tell me why you Cancelled Flightled the flight vs delay
@SouthwestAir @flightspots about time! #mobileboarding is a must!
@SouthwestAir it was 3472
@united refreshes my browser right before checkout.error load message. Ticket price increased $358 in a matter of sec. DoUNotWantMyBusiness?
@USAirways  I have a party of 4 booked for a flight in Aug. At 10:05am, how can I find out how much it would cost to change to an earlier fl
@SouthwestAir should get their shit together before they owe my $2,000 for my bag.
@AmericanAir couldn't get anyone on the phone all day, the flight you rebooked had me missing a conference.We won't be on flt 1568 tomorrow.
@USAirways can u tell me if 5238 from clt to Jan has gotten out of the gate yet?  I will have a tight connection out of clt to mco.
@JetBlue Exciting times ahead! üòÅüéâ
@AmericanAir  your customer service is deplorable. I am disgusted in your company and the ignorant people on the phones for lost baggage.
@USAirways Will the nightmare ever end? Just found out our flight today is delayed due to "ground handling delays affecting a prior flight."
@VirginAmerica you will match my #AmericanAirlines status? Cool!
@united from MEX NRT (dates TBD) but I'm getting a 200 to 300 USD difference in my quotations through September when compared to MEX BKK
@JetBlue you found my camera!  Thank you!  You rock!
@United you need to get it together 3 of 4 flights Cancelled Flightled stranded with no car and my baggage is lost!  You NEVER get it right.
@AmericanAir please confirm 2917 from CID-DFW at 11:30 departure will be/is Cancelled Flighted. Don't want to make the hour drive!
@USAirways Your software is broken. "Call Customer Support" is not the fix. Like I said earlier, yell at your developers.
@USAirways I have corporate-paid travel in April. Is it possible to purchase an upgrade to first class now?
@SouthwestAir are you hiring for flight attendants right now
@USAirways Thank you. But I don‚Äôt understand. What will you do with my feedback?
@JetBlue no seat assignment 5 mins before a flight...line 20 people deep. Guess I'm sitting with the baggage? @MarinaDomine
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/RLWBJ80mA5‚Äù r u serious
@JetBlue that is not what your employee at Logan told me. I finally got one to meet my daughter on her first solo flight after rude rep :(
@USAirways The fact we did not get notified hindered our ability to look for alternate flights before they were snapped up.
@united can you maybe have more than 1 person working customer service desk in Houston airport? Line 3 rows deep 1 person working
@VirginAmerica when can I book my flight to Hawaii??
@USAirways why does it cost $900 to change a $100 ticket when it only cost $150 to purchase a new ticket?
‚Äú@AmericanAir: @Andrew_Wasila We're sorry you were uncomfortable, Andrew. What can we do for you?‚Äù SMA

@USAirways can you add my KTN to an existing reservation?
@southwestair Hi, how do I add a flight to my account? Just created it
@JetBlue Hi! Just wanted to see if you have any new routes planned this year for Newark. Love flying you guys and hope to do so more!
@united what is going on with baggage claim in Newark!#tiredandwanttogohome
@USAirways 4 hours on tarmac in Charleston and still can't get a response after a week. Unacceptable
@AmericanAir Thank you.....you do the same!!
@USAirways No thank you. @AmericanAir was responsive &amp; I found alternate travel home.

@SouthwestAir thanks I think we've got it figured out
@JetBlue and they are telling me I got to get another hotel and food...so spend more money because you guys made me miss my connection
@AmericanAir has no idea what they're doing. Delay 1 flight from 5pm to 7:40pm then delay another TO THE SAME DESTINATION  @ THE SAME TIME.
@JetBlue after my second call to customer service and the fifth person I talked to, an amazing rep fixed it in about 5 mins! :) #persistence
@SouthwestAir Thanks for the quick reply!  I travel a lot...but not that much, lol.
@AmericanAir hi we have lost and found solution we want to offer for free to assist with contacting people when items are found
I left my dildo on the plane is there any way for me to get it back? @united

@SouthwestAir Great job with the Passbook integration! It‚Äôll really help streamline the commute to San Fran! üòä‚òïüì≤‚úà

@USAirways i have been trying ALL WEEK to book a multi city award trip (can't book online) I'm told to call back some other time. What?!?
@USAirways why the hell will you not put us in a hotel when you've stranded us. Your message says mechanical issues not weather. #usairways
@AmericanAir we then had to deplane, and change planes.
@USAirways Been dealing w/ @americanair to solve the probs your team created. Your Manch, NH staff is clearly your C-team, btw. #NotEvenJV
@USAirways Ya'll need to work on your online checkout system. Two bank transactions for one ticket is bush league. Yell at your devs.

@united Can you explain how it rewards us elite Premiere 1K members?

@USAirways it was your fault the flight was delayed to begin with. I shouldn't have to check my bag if there's a bunch of space
@united Cancelled Flighted my mileage plus award reservation G6455C same day. Have yet to see my miles back despite agent confirmation.
@SouthwestAir lost my sunglasses &amp; case on a flight 3933 last night - is there a lost &amp; found?

@united agent helps the person in front of me.  Finishes up with them and then walks away.  The guy behind me is as shocked as I am.
@united troubling news, time to raise the bar on legroom! http://t.co/nmbHNGnMkI
@USAirways DeeDee and Lynn S. have been great here in PHX; Richard P. here was a jerk. Rude to us and our parents for no reason.
@united I sent an email describing my experience. Looking forward to a follow up to hopefully make it right.

@USAirways Nice try.  Doesn't apply to Philly.
@united when is my plane coming?  Been delayed for almost 7 hours. No plane.
@USAirways A tweeted apology is not enough for delay fiasco. NONE for insult from gate agent is worse. Except for Mark N., all bad at CLT.
@SouthwestAir are you kidding me?  I needed help yesterday. I'm now landed and waiting for my connection.  Never will I fly southwest again!
@AmericanAir I did. Should i expect a response in this fiscal year? This calendar year? Never?
@united The engineer that designed the 787 door frame to extend half a foot into the plane for seat 27A should be forced to always sit here
@AmericanAir When will the old 777-200 fly ORD-PVG get upgraded?
@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine Love flying Southwest! Best flight attendants ever!
@united message sent. Thank you!
@SouthwestAir can you follow me? Flight Cancelled Flightled, can't rebook online, been on hold for 2 hours.  Would love to DM flight info. Thank you.
@SouthwestAir Gracias... appreciate that!
@USAirways I was... 4 tomorrow. I missed my meeting today, &amp; it was pointless 2 pay hotel today when the purpose of my trip has been screwed
@VirginAmerica this is too cool!  Never been on ur planes but now I will!!
@united - please help regarding PNR A3ZZ0F. Why am I now waitlisted for a flight?
.@USAirways I rebooked myself - but Cancelled Flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable. You started delaying at 1:30pm.
@USAirways You suck!!  Do you even know the meaning of contingency plan?????
@VirginAmerica save some for 871 tomorrow AM!
@JetBlue as much i have paid in fees. Plus hotel and food because of your changes i could had flown with a more reliable airline #no2jetblue
@AmericanAir so what if I didn't have the funds to purchase another ticket? Your error would cause my family to miss the funeral
@AmericanAir how can I get you guys to respond to my tweets and DM??? Really sad feeling to be ignored.
@AmericanAir I am trying to change the time of a flight I already purchased and was told I have to pay a $400 change fee. Ridiculous.
@JetBlue 5 hours delayed now in hour increments?  Really?  &amp; as Mosaic I still have to pay $25 to use lounge during this waste of a Sunday?
@SouthwestAir trying to fly out of Nashville tomorrow. How is it looking?
@united Over charged me one way for baggage.find out others leaving Pittsburgh with same equipment weren't charged Just hung up on me!!
@SouthwestAir Why do airlines change ticket prices in the middle of the day#annoyed
@united was that English? I'll DM though I don't think you'll make a plane appear.
@JetBlue I spent over an hour of my morning on hold w/ your customer support. I want my confirmed flight to be taken care of
@SouthwestAir my birthday is February 24th which is the date of the imagine dragons in flight concert btw
@united you really need a better system for handling Cancelled Flightled flights http://t.co/3uBCoAsyws
@united since bulkhead seats cannot have bags on floor, why don't u reserve o/head space above those seats? In 1B on UA246 - not impressed
@SouthwestAir been holding for 1 hour and 10 minutes. To rebook Cancelled Flightlation.You guys need more help!
@united yes 1427 Cancelled Flightled. Moved to 333. I'll figure out car rental changes and such.
@SouthwestAir from LGA to San Diego
@SouthwestAir Pls help. On hold 4 long time now. Travelling 4 business and flight 2 ORF from MCI was Cancelled Flightled.  Need to get out there ASAP.
.@USAirways Can't book a flight online or over the phone. Your customer service is usually great -- anything you can do to help?
@JetBlue still waiting for bags from flight 26. It landed an hour ago.
@AmericanAir @Rizzilient After days, I finally got the automated service to call me back but it hung on me! This is beyond ridicules.  help!
@united found the flight on @airfarewatchdog
@USAirways @AmericanAir , you Cancelled Flightled my flight back during the holidays and gave me a refund of $8.51/ticket from PHL to EWR, really?!
@united wonderful bag claim people - finally have my bag. But why did I catch earlier flight? Original flight just landed. #wastedtime
@united and now your rep just hung up on me after over 35 mins on hold because I asked for a supervisor. I'm furious right now.
@United Claudia in IAH terminal b travel assistance has me all set. Great service. Thank you.
@USAirways charging $200 2 change a flight is a rip off the reason I have 2 is out of my hands &amp; I want 2 reschedule same flight but in July
@USAirways already did. I travel for a living, no help at all that it will take 3-4 weeks for any repair. And I have to pay to ship to TX.
@JetBlue Tomorrow wouldn‚Äôt have been soon enough! Thank you for the info!
@JetBlue Thanks.
@USAirways us air should be ashamed of this service - on hold for hours? No help from any representative just to reschedule due to weather ?
@united Trying to locate passenger that landed 2 hrs ago in @HeathrowAirport UA938. can you assist? Is flight still in customs? PLEASE help
@JetBlue status of flight 684 from MCO to LGA tomorrow?
@USAirways My flight (US558) got Cancelled Flightled on 2/16 due to lack of flight crew.I was told that I'd be reimbursed for hotel. Who do I contact?
@AmericanAir pretty impressed with the in flight entertainment. Full touch, usable, smooth, good selection.
@USAirways it is really embarrassing when asking for complimentary drink/snack detailed here: https://t.co/9zA6xb1h89 &amp; being argued with.
@united coupled with self-service policies/cost cutting exacerbates the noted issues. (3/3)
@AmericanAir so whats the hold up on flight 4302?
@JetBlue THANKS!! Her 80th bday is Saturday. We're having an aviation themed surprise party for her.
@southwestair Flight 4146 Phi to Den was staffed by a great crew. #freecomedyshow #newlifetimecustomer
@united hi JH. Yes please. Since I lost almost a whole day on the way out, could you help me change my return for one day Late Flightr?
@AmericanAir can you do anything to get #AA953 moving? Been almost 24 hrs and hundreds at jfk upset, tired and want to get to BA.
@SouthwestAir For my Grandma Ella's 80th, she would love a bday greeting from your flight crew! She was a stewardess for Eastern Airlines.
@USAirways we are boarding now but have yet to depart.  Thanks for the response.
@JetBlue Spent most of the winter in NNY with Mom,  JetBlue will take me home to FL via BOS on Mon. Miss hubby, kitties, warm #countingdown
@SouthwestAir no self help way to put in tsa pre check number for existing reservation. Very annoying. 800 is not reachable.
@AmericanAir Got an email about an itinerary change, but can't seem to get to anyone on phone. New flight time doesn't work for me. Help?
@SouthwestAir your phone service sucks
@USAirways I have received two reservation check-ins for two different flights for my one flight tomorrow morning. Need assistance ASAP
@JetBlue Apparently, the substitute pilots for flight #69 from BOS to FLL can't be found. No info is avail from the counter. How about you?
@united is it on a flight now? Thanks for reply.
@JetBlue they were amazing and thank you!
@JetBlue tough choices but I did all simultaneously! As a business traveler, best experience in a long time. #wishmyflightwaslonger #what
@AmericanAir there is a full flight of customers sitting on the plane waiting for baggage to be loaded on AA 356 in DFW - why? 2 hour delay
@USAirways gate agents are now working with everyone to resolve connecting flight issues which is my concern
@united will do. Just need to get CVG.... and my bag too. Thanks
@AmericanAir u Cancelled Flightled my flight for tomorrow and tell me to call reservations but then refuse to take my call!!!  #not cool #hateful
@united I believe you have to follow me in order for me send you a DM
@united what you did was illegal and a breach of contract. I will be in touch but not through your "customer feedback"
@USAirways will do. Hoping for a voucher for a future flight #Optimistic
@JetBlue "Goodwill" now at $125.00.  $27,000 x ? = Fine   Still want your new CEO to make a public apology to all passengers of flight 136
@USAirways great, thank you!
@JetBlue shout out to the crew on flight 89 headed back to the big apple, they kept my glass half full the whole flight! #jetbluejfk
@USAirways we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight.
@AmericanAir Do you have any flights with lie flat seating from STL to PDX around the date of March 5?
@SouthwestAir How can we get refund instead of credit for flight that you Cancelled Flightled? We couldn't switch to a flight tomorrow.
@AmericanAir Thanks that was done, I just don't understand why those whose bags couldn't fit aren't notified in air/at landing #technology
@JetBlue great flight! Great view! :-) http://t.co/Yxn00pnOav
@united I am furious.  You're firm is a disgrace. Despite all our efforts you did zero to protect our daughter. All alone at night # United
@SouthwestAir coming up on 10 hrs and all at the gate, not leaving and without my baggage. SWA you are my nightmare!
@AmericanAir 3078 is overweight so you pull 2 dozen passengers off? Why not luggage? Seriously?
@AmericanAir been calling all morning. Still can't get through. I need to chge a flight that is this week!!!!!
@USAirways well this is #nofun #nocustomerservice #onhold trying to make #reservations #nothappy http://t.co/m7MMq2f5FA
@united thanks
@AmericanAir love how you can't get an agent on the phone and the automated system hangs up on you
@AmericanAir you have the poorest trained employees at these desks. I haven't even started to discuss the #lostluggage yet
@united thanks for the reply. To clarify, the airfare is similar to your likely intended peer group. The $3 beer charge, however, is not
@united and learn how to book flights. http://t.co/MHHS9RUpLv
@USAirways you got me home 30 hours after you were supposed to... I was living in an airport, you offered no monetary assistance!
@USAirways You all work hard at making sure things flow smoothly. Keeping positive.
@united I think DM would be better
@united It was quite enjoyable. üòä Except now he's stuck on the runway in Houston. üòï
@AmericanAir there's a lot of talks and no doing. MIA-SFO on a 20+ year old plane #nonewplanes #old #shame http://t.co/TwETPXUpPN
@JetBlue the best airline in the world
@JetBlue will I be compensated for delays or Cancelled Flightlation?
@USAirways I will NEVER travel US Airways again. Flew in from LA to DC last night and for the 2nd time on this airline my bags didn't arrive
@united Is flight 5001 really going to leave Newark today?  If not tell us now and I will rent a car.  I do not want to end up stranded.
@JetBlue nope. This 8:45am flight is now not leaving until almost 5pm. 5! I can't believe I paid money for this.
@AmericanAir it's not about the weather. It's about the fact that I can't get ahold of anyone to help. BUT you can tweet me back.
@USAirways thanks for getting us on ur plane. Awesome flight attendant who is making us smile after difficult travel. #customerservice
@USAirways I would be on my way but   wether has delayed yet again.. Love the Charlotte ice storm!!  Good luck with mad customers
@united I think you guys had a half full flight at 4 so you held our overbooked 3pm flight to fill the other one then Cancelled Flightled mine
@SouthwestAir I notice that there are separate buttons for "guitar" and actual "music" in this pic. Some bands should take note of this.
@AmericanAir By the time the 2 hrs passed before I got a call back, the ticket was more $$. It wasn't my fault yet I had to pay extra
@AmericanAir you guys are killing me. http://t.co/22iPGeIcSm
@AmericanAir - trying to track down backs for two of my attendees #help
@united didn't get her name. She was not in our group. She was sitting behind us. Think it was window seat #40? We only overheard...
@united might possibly have the worst service on the planet.
@united, we're stuck at OGG, looks like flight will be Cancelled Flightled. Can you help? =)
@JetBlue Thanks. Used phone instead of computer and it worked!! Thx again!
@USAirways BF has been stuck in CLT all day. Is the lounge offering free "This weather sucks &amp; we all want to cry" tequila shots?
@AmericanAir your cabin 'thank you' message reminds people about having choices when they fly. I will be choosing another airline next time.
@united worst flights I've ever had. ground crew ignored our plane, made me miss flight and now I have to cover the cost of a hotel. #DEN
@AmericanAir you can't change my flights and not have enough operators to handle calls.... #unacceptable #AmericanAirlines
@VirginAmerica thank you! I absolutely will üòé
@united Appreciated, but in this case we waited an extra 55 minutes for a lost mechanic to fax the log. Fax...like in the 80s.
@SouthwestAir can you follow me so I can send you the info?
@AmericanAir @united getting us to where we need to be. This is not acceptable. Not to mention, Cancelled Flighting meetings/interviews for my client
@SouthwestAir ok thank you  i hope  so too
@AmericanAir I'd love to take my seat, but it appears as though someone already has.  #disappointed #upgrademe #wtf http://t.co/9Gx5mMmubb
@USAirways just now but no general announcement
@SouthwestAir Wasn't able to sit in my seat since the guy next to me was using it. #worstflightever #ideserveareward http://t.co/l7hSnLgie2
@AmericanAir LITERALLY just told me they'd rather have an empty seat than my mom get to come earlier &amp; take me to Dr. appointment. WOW
@USAirways And cherry on top-flight 880 was on runway after we landed ON TIME for 45 mins. Still didn't get half the luggage.
@SouthwestAir thanks for losing my luggage
@AmericanAir how we looking? We going to be able to get out on time? #flight353
@USAirways not yet. But we will see shortly.
@AmericanAir we had to sit in the airport a long periolodicly time. the planes were nasty
@USAirways the American Eagle plane you're using for CLT to RDU is disgusting! You should be ashamed! #disgusting #ew http://t.co/B4xhiRuGzV
@united Just saying the truth. You don't even an email! #2015
@united UA flight 1247. SFO to LAX took my carry on at gate. I'm Group 2, overhead bins are empty
@united Case ID 8544484
@USAirways charged my card 11 times for one airline ticket, now card is on security hold
@united we finally just arrive to Bogota, good but long flight!!
@JetBlue Thank you for the JetBlue Credit. Nice save :-)
@AmericanAir Aww cool! It's nice to know they are still up above my head then. One of my faves.
@united WHy is my KTN not showing on my boarding?  Why is TSA pre-check not applying to my boarding pass?
@AmericanAir I'd like to explore both options, and what the cost might be to change the date and destination.
@USAirways ur specialist said they would talk to the stewardess about not serving drunks drinks, REALLY how does that help
@SouthwestAir @TomVH just get the RR credit card and get the points of family that way
@SouthwestAir there is a good chance myself nor anyone else in this airport will ever be Flight Booking Problems southwest again..
@JetBlue to Increase Charter Service to Cuba - #Travel Agent http://t.co/lYQrb4HCYU
@AmericanAir are flights leaving Dallas right now? In Maui trying to figure out how delayed flight 7 is going to be
@JetBlue I think I have it selected already ‚ò∫Ô∏è
@united Actually, the flight was just Cancelled Flightled! http://t.co/Qf0Oc2HqeZ
@united just emailed Jim Compton and Jeff Smisek so hopefully you pay attention now
@JetBlue Great thanks
@JetBlue OK, thank you.
@USAirways @AmericanAir our honeymoon was delayed a day because a gas cap was not screwed on! Flight 1801- so frustrating!
@USAirways I was told a "return call" by a human
@United so you jacked out my cousins trip to Portland and then Cancelled Flightled her return trip?! No more United
@USAirways Thank you so much its been a very stressful day
@united your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn't have a gate agent once we got a gate.
@united that link is not helpful as it does not put me In touch with management
@jetblue had me on hold foreverrrrrr
@JetBlue thanks for the upgradeüòâ!! so far so good. #KeepItUp http://t.co/BKmfeY7QOL
@united whom can I call to discuss - as I was told that united has no phone contact with passengers  - this is absurd...
@AmericanAir how are the runways at DFW? Will you be flying Late Flightr today? Thanks.
@USAirways. Yet another delay/missed connection....and your customer service has an attitude with me? Wow.
@USAirways overloads small plane with extra baggage and then. Has to take them off... Poor execution #4435, 75 minute delay...
@united why don't you allow families with small children to board first anymore? Our next flight will be on another airline...
@SouthwestAir are bicycles that the 62", 50lbs criteria free or bikes are automatically $75/each way? The FAQ page isn't very clear to me.
@SouthwestAir now I'm so lucky for my forced good deed I get to be smashed between 2 huge ppl in the exit row. Thank God I'm tiny. üòÇüíÅ
Listen, im not gonna deny this but... RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/eNXV64RkbU
@AmericanAir @lpalumbo what weather sun is out
@united @Apollochplayers we just want to go home tonight - why did you Cancelled Flight the last leg of our reserv. w/out our permission??! #PH6RPS
@SouthwestAir - thanks for Cancelled Flighting our flight to BOS. We're stranded in DEN til Wed night. The 7 of us will never fly #southwest again
@SouthwestAir Gate attendant at McCarran C16 (Vegas to Dallas) went above and beyond. After a long day of frustration it was welcome.
@united submitted customer care form Jan 7th. Still no response. A little longer then 7 - 10 business days
@AmericanAir Can you provide guidance on how I should work with them to resolve the issue
@JetBlue great.
@AmericanAir you can tweet but not call! You're like a bad boyfriend!
@JetBlue FYI - your android app is set to not be applicable with the Nexus 6 - please fix (its a phone, not a tablet). Cheers!
@SouthwestAir @TheEllenShow @Imaginedragons this job interferes w/Ellen Show &amp; concerts! will alway treasure my @LiveAtFirefly experience!
@USAirways I don't like being lied to. No bad weather in dc md va. I've been stuck in CA all day and should've been home by now. You owe me.
@united as a freq flyer it makes me sad to see cust needing assistance treated so poorly. #ServiceFail
@united flt 4567 has had two more updates in the last 3 minutes.
@USAirways Almost home ...East Coast Freeze headed to PHL connect AVP TGIF http://t.co/WXowZhpgfL
@AmericanAir if this is how you guys work then i will never fly with you guys again.
@USAirways them and @AmericanAir
@SouthwestAir followed.
@united was so on point for 5/6 of my flights this past week . . But this last one really sucks shit
@USAirways : i was told my ticket expired but  i never recvd any notice  before it expired .This sucks.i paid 40k miles &amp; $125 for the tckt
@USAirways flight scheduled for 730pm...told at 150am that flight is Cancelled Flightled after sitting on cold plane for 2 hours.
@SouthwestAir - We left iPad in a seat pocket.  Filed lost item report. Received it exactly 1 week Late Flightr.  Is that a record?  #unbelievable
@AmericanAir - cluster continues-still on connecting instead of direct..bag charged and seats not together. #shafted
@united Bummer. Might have to go with @AmericanAir card instead. TY for response though.
@united 877 from amsterdam to ewr, 02.27.2015, 737-300.
@SouthwestAir and currently as im bringing my 3 year old to the bathroom I'm being rushed by the flight attendant.
@AmericanAir It's not what happens to us that matters...It's our response that matters. Way to drop the ball AA.
@USAirways delayed my flight 3 times before Cancelled Flighting it, had angry and rude workers, and are now providing no helpful service at all
@united customer service sucks!  They hang up after waiting an hour and talking for 5 minutes.
@JetBlue woof.
@USAirways Oh well. I'll get to Cancun eventually.
@united thank you for fully boarding flight 1689 this morning before noticing we had no pilots. #fail
@united our travel booked thru United group dept. Okc ticket agent less than willing to help with our connection in LAX.
@united If it's any consolation, your staff was stellar. Just not the hour+ delays I encountered with every one of my 4 flights.
@USAirways and I can't get through on any phones
@USAirways holding 30+ min and listening to your shitty ads on repeat for your credit make me hate your airline even more.  @delta is better
@AmericanAir @kaps12 this is an international airline that experienced record profits last quarter. But they can't staff a call center
@united Thanks for nothing. Next time I'll bring a whole extra suitcase for my 1 extra pound. That makes sense, right?
@united bags are still in Houston since Friday and still have not been reimbursed the baggage fee.
@united was no one between the scan and inside the plane. I just asked the people in line around me where the plane was going
@jetblue any idea where the plane for flight 672 is coming from? I thought flight 305 from JFK but that wouldn't explain delay.
@AmericanAir I can DM it to you, if you follow me
@united tremendous. What would you recommend?
@AmericanAir your service is horrible. I can't get a straight answer from your ground agents.
@JetBlue I want to enter the family pooling contest, it says "by 2/19" on the website, can I please enter still!
@USAirways I was completely ripped of by US Airways today never fly this airline  I am contacting my local news
@USAirways After today,no reason 4 anyone to not approve merger with @AmericanAir,other airlines have no reason to fear losing business to U
@JetBlue tell the truth - this is a pic of your social media community managers isn't it? http://t.co/e2AXlqzWvh
@united silly I'm flying delta today. Your united club staff and attendants are surly and unhelpful and always seem bothered by pesky folk
@USAirways yesterday we were delayed for SIX hours w/lil to NO explanation we paid LOTS of $$ 2 fly w/u &amp; this is how u treat ur customers?
@USAirways flight 645 to Phoenix deboards passengers going to Salt Lake City because they can't resolve a simple bathroom issue. #fail
@SouthwestAir for my travel I see bz class and get away are sld out. Anytime is available . How do I know how many anytime are available?
Nice RT @VirginAmerica: The man of steel might be faster, but we have WiFi ‚Äì just saying. #ScienceBehindTheExperience http://t.co/FGRbpAZSiX
@SouthwestAir a companion pass flyer to other airlines because it's being abused @ every airport...
@USAirways missing my reservations due to a Cancelled Flightled flight. Make it right by giving me first class tomorrow. Make your customers happy.
@USAirways agree! Richard P. Literally ripped up our tixs in our faces and made rude, inappropriate comments to us and our family. Awful!
@AmericanAir thank you, truly appreciate the help, just sent a DM
@AmericanAir Educate Bohol is a 501(c)(3) w/all volunteer staff. I can help the kids or buy a plane ticket--I can't do both. Can you help?
@united   Pushing 2 hours on hold. Priceless. http://t.co/thS10LDY2a
@united error message said couldn't process request at the last step after seat selection on each leg. Agent was unaware of an (1 of 2)
@VirginAmerica love you guys, but pls get some direct routes LAS to AUS!
@united thanks for having ground crews that are surprised when flights arrive. #beingsuckontarmacsucks!
@united What does DM the confirmation @ mean???
@united your flights are really cheap what's the catch
@united A broken luggage and a mild case of food poisoning from UA5 LHR-IAH. Who can I email about this?
Thanks @SouthwestAir ! #heartlanta
@USAirways doesn't seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn't help #usairwaysfail
@SouthwestAir @love_dragonss oh my god LAUREN OH MY GOD OH MY GOD
@united two years old.  Birthdate 11/13/2012
@VirginAmerica FYI the info@virginamerica.com email address you say to contact in password reset emails doesn't exist. Emails bounce.
@united Thanks for looking into this and for getting back to me via DM. Glad to hear my bag is finally being delivered to me. Thanks again!
@SouthwestAir All pieces were found and safely delivered to our home this afternoon.
@AmericanAir Its not that I wasn't offered "perks" by @USAirways.  I ASKED and was told, "NO." #thenewamerican
@AmericanAir not sure why I would bother when the agent at the airport didnt help &amp; nobody on phone would. Ticket Cancelled Flightled for no reason.
@AmericanAir My bag flew with AA while I flew with Delta, and I'm still not sure whose final carrier is referred to.
@SouthwestAir quick question - i bought wifi for my phone, do I have to buy it again on my tablet? I have 9 hours left on my trip
@USAirways First class no snack basket was catered so drinks only No preflight drink or coathanging 1st drink service 50 min after take off
@SouthwestAir please do something about the speed of your WiFi connections on your planes.  It might as well be non-existent.
@united wow you even answered back!  Awesome! @AmericanAir @USAirways That's customer service!!! #usairwaysfail
@USAirways flight 837 passengers stuck on plane in Philly. Where is the gangway?  We can't hear the pilot
@USAirways Flight 496. How are u going to compensate me for sitting on the tarmac for 90+ mins and missing my PHX - BOS connection?
@AmericanAir wow. Flight crew shows up :15 mins before the flight. No catering for AA3390. Nice. Why to treat your customers.
@USAirways PLEASE improve your phone system! Going through multiple prompts &amp; menus just to be told to call back Late Flightr = MAJOR FAIL
@AmericanAir between your airline and @united I've now spent three extra days traveling (DOMESTIC) and spent hundreds of dollars...
@USAirways nothing important to do.  Why was I told to wait in the @AmericanAir line?  #patiencerunningout
@SouthwestAir thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è you guys!
@SouthwestAir, thanks for being so good to us #military folk. It's cold in #StLouis but I sure enjoyed my flight. http://t.co/RcdH183Q1J
@united Big thanks to Ms. Winston for assisting me over the phone with a baggage claim issue today. She really went the extra mile!
@united always makes our cross country flights rad. @hemispheresmag here's baby flier Charlotte! #8thtime5MonthsOld http://t.co/kCqnwIXUCm
@united the costumer services here at Denver Intl Airport is ridiculous bad!
@united no it weighed 45.5 and it was the only checked bag
@SouthwestAir Yes. Please train your customer service agents with correct protocol.. I should not be receiving different 411 evrytime I call
@united I'm over you. Evry 1st flight I take w/ you is delayed &amp; evry 2nd is on time so its missed evry time. #lastflightofthenight #breakup
@united question. Are departure times based off eastern central time or the time zone your actually in?
@SouthwestAir it's a new day and a new chance for you to do the right thing it's never too Late Flight to be honest.
@JetBlue you can't beat jetblue in space's matter http://t.co/NRpWmGyv3e
@AmericanAir @AmericanAir how do you expect to do that?
@USAirways yeah you guys just told me to call the website that I booked from. I booked on your website. UNACCEPTABLE
@AmericanAir do you guys have wifi on international flights?
@united They finally gave in a let him on. After they threatened to send him back to Vegas on coach. Thnx.
@JetBlue lol at your "estimated departure time." Plane hasn't even started boarding yet. You can't even get your delays right.
@VirginAmerica Applied for Status Match on Feb 1. Got confirmation email same day. Still no news though. You guys have dropped ball Late Flightly üò•
@SouthwestAir love the passbook update. Used it the day after it was released. Finally!! Thank you!
@JetBlue @vegecomgirl For me it‚Äôs not until 6/15.
@SouthwestAir Hey there, can you follow us so we can DM you a question :) üòÅ
@USAirways Thank you. And thanks for being so accommodating.
@united oh no, I'm rebooked, 7+ hours after my original arrival time. We can talk compensation.
@united man I can't wait to book my ticket now! Thanks JP you're a life sabe
@AmericanAir waiting for you to pick up... Coming up on 3 hours now... http://t.co/nOPq5xIsbS
@united what is your plan to reduce delays?
@JetBlue it was but obviously it wasn't linked as there is nothing there when I tried to book with it.
@USAirways this made me have to Cancelled Flight my car reservation and it came out to more money...why did you reschedule a time without the crew?
@southwestair @cspkcats let us know if we can help
@AmericanAir I think 2 weeks of waiting is more than enough time for you to contact me.  This is why you lose customers
@USAirways Youre batting .1000. Every flight Ive taken is delayed. Worst airline. ever.
@SouthwestAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight to EWR. Flt 3076. U also Cancelled Flightled flights to LGA. Yet @united is flying on time to both. WTH??
@AmericanAir we have been rebooked due to weather, but need to change our reservation and fly on the 24th, instead of the 23rd.
@united thanks gate agent extraordinaire Seau Fong for helping me get re-booked out of Boise and (hopefully) home to NYC sometime tonight!
More like BaeJet Airways, amirite?‚Äú@JetBlue: @terrybrokebad Right back at ya!‚Äù
@united I bought a ticket yesterday and received a confirmation. Tried to check in and they said I hadn't paid for it. So I called was on
@virginamerica you ROCK for making it so I can watch #Oscars on my flight!! #redcarpet #oscars #oscars2015
@AmericanAir Another customer non service from you. If we waited for you to solve the problem we would miss the funeral. You suck!
@JetBlue - looking forward to it when we finally take off.
@united She üëè won't üëè be üëè at üëè my üëè wedding üëè. This is an irreplaceable milestone. There's no reFlight Booking Problems. How can we be repaid for this?
@USAirways 45 min hold time then a hang up by Manager Mike in dividend miles dept. tough to justify sticking with the Us air CC and status.
@USAirways flight 728 from PHL to London has been sitting on the tarmac for 46min w/NO further update from the pilot. what gives???
but why RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/W0HOAewhwS
@JetBlue thank you!!
@united Is there a direct number to call to request a refund?  Its telling me its not valid as I changed the ticket.  No number on site
@AmericanAir Hi. Get error msg when trying to check in on line. States: wrong pass#. Tickets rcvd from AA due to training in DFW. U know Y?
@united thnx ^LO :-)
@JetBlue is there also a way I can get a printed one for my records? I keep them whenever I fly ;)
@united  #UnitedAirlines  how long will1531 be delayed.
@USAirways that's who I spoke to already. We've already booked another flight w/someone else. Thanks for your concern. Just wanted to
@united Yes I needed plenty of assistance but received none.
@VirginAmerica good to be home #texas #moodlighting http://t.co/N3BVZTY3zI
@USAirways Flight gets in 30 minutes early and all goodwill gone when bags aren't here 45 minutes Late Flightr
@united ooh thanks!
@SouthwestAir - really?  All other carriers are staffed and you've got a triple looped one and no employees in sight in OKC
@VirginAmerica On all your flights?
@JetBlue Also, thanks for your prompt replies. I'm really impressed--and you're not just brushing me off. Much appreciated!
@JetBlue #1680 Super smooth flight and landing. Nicely done.
@AmericanAir Will do. Appreciate the replies though.
@united yes. On a nonstop to Memphis tomorrow morning. With the snow coming in I got my fingers crossed it will go.
@AmericanAir @dfwairport Guys, let it go. http://t.co/vOxcghciJi
@VirginAmerica you suck!
@united Understood and thanks! I should have tried reaching out sooner.
@SouthwestAir @BernhardtJH I did eventually get through but that flight Cancelled Flightled.  Decided to drive but gave up holding to process refund
@SouthwestAir 20 passengers on this plane. I should've just grabbed my baggage and gave it its own seat.
@united truly the WORST day of flying I have ever experienced...
@JetBlue Any EMS window seats on 1099 tomorrow?
@united 732 from Denver. We just boarded! Fingers crossed we get into the air!!!
@USAirways how about a phone # to talk to a real person?
@USAirways Plus a US Airways - you need to do something about this! I left Philly to thaw out!!!! http://t.co/pKy7ZhnNRH
@JetBlue flight booked! Heading out to California with the @WikiPearl team for  @NatProdExpo on March 6-8! Can't wait! #ExpoWest
@JetBlue @ProfessorpaUL15 Always happy to help!
@AmericanAir Can you upgrade (with cash) to Main Cabin Extra after buying an AAdvantage Mileage Saver (using miles)? Can't seem to do it...
@JetBlue our #FoodAllergy community. IF you want our continued loyalty, you need to do better than that. Perhaps some training is in (2/3)
@JetBlue probably not anymore.
@united Why do I still not have my bags? They arrived @10AM &amp;website says they're still at the airport..2 1/2 hours Late Flightr???!! #nothappy
@SouthwestAir really easy for locals to get down to the strip. book.
@AmericanAir @USAirways - I'm pregnant with twins and you're going to abandon me overnight in an airport? No hotel? When it's your fault?
@united this happens all the time.  United pilots are always in the exit row.  America treats there customers better than their employees.
@SouthwestAir Thanks. I did go through these motions shortly after my flight yesterday. I wonder how quickly flight attendants are notified.
@USAirways HELLO?! It's been FOUR HOURS since plane landed!   Flt 630 phx to JFK.  3 hrs on Tarmac waiting 4 gate. Plus an hour no bags yet
@USAirways what do I push to rebook with that 800 number
@AmericanAir @USAirways stated before I'm not getting any help there. Tk over 8 hrs yest to spk to a live person then told to chk the site.
@united Is your company motto: "I do not care!!!"  I heard several times from your employees to your clients in the past week."  #idonotcare
@JetBlue Airways Corporation Registers High Short Interest - Wall Street Pulse http://t.co/hXSnv7fbbh
@SouthwestAir I think I'm shot. Can't find a flight that arrives before business (SAN) on thu. Really want to go too.
@USAirways your team member at DCA- Tamara R. is her name was awesome. You should have more employees like her!
@united either your staff or whoever you contract with at PVD is failing you big time tonight...
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/4LlWi5oxvO‚Äù lmfaooooo hook me up with a flight!
@USAirways waiting for bags now over 25min in Phl bag claim!
@united Freakin"
@JetBlue it's ok. Things happen. Just very frustrated when you have to change your schedule. See you tomorrow for a new rescheduled flight.
@united I tried 2 DM it would not go thru... not sure why
@USAirways #SOS WHERE IS MY BAG ?
@united Still do not have my bag, it's in the CLT airport. Was originally told I would have it by 2pm.
@AmericanAir Deplaned for the 3rd fucking time. Fuck you AA.
@USAirways Ill never fly you again due to the emotional &amp; financial stress you have caused me because of one of your staff members errors.
@USAirways any chance u can help our family rebook their flight that was Cancelled Flightled, #4487?
@united u guys did it again changed ages and double booked seats so I had to I've even though I have platinum and the other person none
@united I live abroad and am Flight Booking Problems flights for when I come visit the states :(
@JetBlue It was fabulous! Very pleased.
@JetBlue will call. Thank you!
@USAirways Hi-i have a travel question. Could you please follow me so i can dm you?
@VirginAmerica You have the best flight attendant ever!!! http://t.co/PxdEL1nq3l
@SouthwestAir Thank you.
@SouthwestAir it's not letting me DM you !!
@USAirways Cool. Now @SweetingR has been told you can't re-route his bags after he was told to leave them last night. He needs them to race.
@AmericanAir Flight 953 NYC-Buenos Aires has been delay since yesterday at 10PM. Is going to take off at 3.30PM now? Give us answers!
@USAirways 1500 characters are not enough to convey the issue. Was directed to emailmailto:customer.relations@usairways.com unmonitored. BAD
@USAirways Joined Silver Preferred because I heard customer service was so great, pity I was misguided.
@united 2 Cancelled Flighted flights Late Flightr, agent claimed she put me on a new flight but then Cancelled Flighted it. Coworker got on flight- now delayed. Now?
@united you failed me last week at IAH. Next intl trip on Delta. Small ual flight from lax booked, that's it!
@united Any news about the departure of the flight UA51?
@virginamerica.. Can you help? Left my blazer in. Kooples jacket bag at 3rd row second seat from right gate 36 T3 lax.. Flight to sfo
@JetBlue also not have food available even for purchase is quite shocking since this is a 5 hour international flight.
@united you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections
@JetBlue thanks! I'll do it.
@united maybe one day you'll be the one quoted on http://t.co/mJkpgVXmPC
@JetBlue @EllaHenderson the highlight of being delayed #freeconcert
@united couldn't have possibly messed up our trip anymore than they did. Thanks for being such a terrible airline. #disappointed
@AmericanAir I tried several times to select seats. The only ones ever available would've cost me $30 extra per seat.
@united Thanks for explanation. It seems like an odd incentive structure, tho, because it dramatically diminishes the value of the certs.
@SouthwestAir you have let me down! #oversold #earlybirdmeansnothing
@AmericanAir haha I did. They said it wasn't their fault somehow? You guys r a joke
@united You can bump me up to Group 3 so I won't be forced to check my bag and wait 30+ minutes at LGA.
@JetBlue Is today's JetBlue Flight 918 (NYC-&gt;BOS) delayed? My app says on time and the website says it's not...
@AmericanAir not having pillows or blankets or a flight home for 40 people does bad things to my hair
@USAirways what about AA miles for USAir flights booked through American?
@SouthwestAir  Please Help. We really want to fly with you. #guessweflyingdelta
@USAirways been sitting on the tarmac for 90 mins now bc engine is broken. How are u going to compensate passengers #WorstAirline
@SouthwestAir experiencing the worst customer service ever currently. Waited for CS rep, then put "on hold" but actually was hung up on.
@united how about starting without the robotic response?
@USAirways yeah either by refunding my money or 2 free round trips to compensate for all the trouble we were put through.
@JetBlue any chance you will by this summer?
@JetBlue thanks for the info... Figured that was the case. Hopefully my new hashtag will change that ;) #ABCLetJetBlueStreamFeed
@VirginAmerica why can't we book seats on your flights when we buy them or even during check in? Creates so much anxiety! #frustrated
@united Apparently they are asking 20 people to off board the plane--how can such a big miscalculation be made?!
@united I asked a legitimate question about systemwide vs. localized problems, and got back an unreLate Flightd copy/paste. You can do better.
@USAirways I have contacted them but only got an automated response that won't give me the code.
@united sorry, wrong link for the bag : http://t.co/pZAl4wtrEZ Thats the one i meant
@southwestair has posted flight schedule covering the date range of @_defcon_ 23
@AmericanAir so we've now been driving across DFW for over 90mins. That's half fucking way to Texarkana! #shouldhavedriven
@USAirways it is the same passenger, just her maiden name ended up as last name through online Flight Booking Problems.  Yes, understand non transferable
@united welcome to our world, that's a snow world today. @GooseBayAirport Goose Bay, Labrador, Canada. http://t.co/4kI6Xr67nk
@SouthwestAir @AARP #tfw1 Appreciate the tweet back - It was unexpected.
@JetBlue follow for DM please
@united enjoyed #heathrow lounge so much i almost missed my @airnzusa flight!
@JetBlue that's what they told me half an hour ago
@united flt 4567 no gate agent, no announcements. So unprofessional. Time to go back to @Delta
@AmericanAir @ejacqui If you updated the screens, then people would know the Late Flightst info, good or bad. And that wouldn't work because...
@VirginAmerica Flight from BOS &gt; LAS tomorrow was Cancelled Flightled. No notification; wait times are 1+ hour. Will you rebook on another airline?
@USAirways pure anarchy on flight 555 to SLC. People walking in with nothing packed in bags with arms full of stuff. #getittogether
@USAirways standing in line with 100 people all looking to do the same
@AmericanAir I was going to change it to tomorrow because I am concerned if the fllight does make I won't be able to leave the airport   1/2
@AmericanAir they @cathaypacific @cathaypacificUS can't even tell me what country they are in üò•üò•
@AmericanAir I want to speak to a human being! !!  This is not an obscene request!
@AmericanAir now I understand!!
@USAirways so far I've gotten six different answers
@SouthwestAir I'm stuck in Fort Lauderdale.
@united I have such a love hate relationship with you. Some days you're good, the others you are so terribly awful its saddening
@united please be good to me this weekend!
@united Shame that there's no flex to tickets transfer rules.  Even calling from Neurosurgery ICU isn't enough!
@JetBlue well, now I'll make sure to never fly JetBlue
@SouthwestAir Hello remaining credits on your account will be refunded back to your credit card, when you choose a lower price flight?
@AmericanAir Do you have any sort of live chat feature? We're in the UK right now and that call would cost us alot. :(
@SouthwestAir has grounded 2 flights b/c of equipment problems &amp; been rude to my wife, traveling alone w/our 2 young kids.  never again.
@VirginAmerica I am in seat 4C and I cannot even open my laptop; and I paid extra for this seat!!
@JetBlue üëç. I think I'll come take a nap at the terminal.  ;)
@AmericanAir Worst airline ever. We have been stranded for 24 hours because of your 7 hour delay with flight 104 last night.
@SouthwestAir thank you!
@SouthwestAir so glad u guys do business w/ more class than UR competitors @SpiritAirlines üòè
@JetBlue I'm #MakingLoveOutofNothingAtAll on my #brandloveaffair to #LAX https://t.co/kdHRUF54sW
@AmericanAir made it!  Thanks AA!
@AmericanAir delayed on the way to Puerto Rico and delayed on the way back to New York, this is disgraceful
@USAirways so I was just told I was coded as an upgrade... I clearly purchased this seat with my miles and refuse to downgrade. #ripoff
@USAirways my option is to use twitter. Most of the people working for u have no clue what they do. they tell you to go to A4 but its b16
@JetBlue Thank you guys! Brilliant customer service
@AmericanAir now the second flight I was put on was Cancelled Flightled with no explanation!! Missed my first meeting!!#outragedüò°üò°
@AmericanAir did you know that suicide is the second leading cause of death among teens 10-24?
@SouthwestAir need to learn how to treat people with respect and just a little dignity. #FAIL
@SouthwestAir Trying to add my dog on the flight but can't get through.
@united please see dm!!
@USAirways US 728 then lost ground power three different times. Not only grounded endlessly; now without air, lights, entertainment.
@USAirways will all flights out of DFW be Cancelled Flightled today?

@AmericanAir TSA said there is nothing they could do. But the question is why are your employee's swapping your customers belongings?
@USAirways I don't mind waiting, I mind waiting on a plane, when I shouldn't have had to.  The airport has more room and you know.. food!
@united thanks, I'm booked. Just spent an extra 7 hrs in the TEN w/ no explanation. Now flying middle seat to CHAR instead of Memphis.
@USAirways So when was I supposed to call the Internet Desk? Especially since my reservation told me to directly call the main 1-800 number?
@USAirways 4 hours . How do I change my flight that was Cancelled Flightled ?
@united you guys continue to impress me in Houston. http://t.co/cIh1qNllcM
@united no chance I wait in ORD all afternoon for another flight after you screwed me. Hold 5396
@USAirways your customer service is atrocious.
@united what's the best way to get your tickets? Print off at home or go to check in desk?
The saga of the @MelissaAFrancis bag delay w/ @United - will there be a reunion or will she be forced to go shopping? Stay tuned.
@AmericanAir stiiiil waiting. Please respond as my flight leaves in 2 1/2 hrs
@JetBlue No, it is one I'm trying to make, but it is probably too Late Flight. I did not see an email that I could call. Pittsburgh International.
@AmericanAir I certainly hope my LA /PBI on 25 th has a NEW plane . The seats on Feb 11 th flight ( in reverse) God awful
@united mine is GJQX6J husband is A587CW (Can't DM for some reason.)
@SouthwestAir do you have all winners for @Imaginedragons #DestinationDragons
@AmericanAir thanks. They did not charge anything in the end so all is good.
@usairways It was 9¬∫, and some of us had left coats in our luggage in anticipation of cramped overhead bins :|
@USAirways I been sitting on this plane for 40 minutes, and they are saying another 15 minutes something about paper work. This sucks !!
BY THE GRACE OF GOD, I MADE IT! ‚Äú@USAirways: @__RWG__ We don't have those powers in here. We hope you can make that flight.‚Äù
@VirginAmerica we have a hot female pilot! Sweet! DCA to SFO! :-)
@USAirways I forgot my password and I don't know if my username is correct, and i want to use my miles, what i have to do??
.@AmericanAir after 50 minutes on hold, and another 30 minutes on the call yes. Going to be pushing it to get to the airport on time now
@united - That time when I spent a night trying to sleep in a toddler bed at the airport Ramada without my luggage you kidnapped #furious
@SouthwestAir  Tried to DM you, it won't let me as it says you are not following me.
@USAirways and after six hours even the gate agent got fed up and left us all on line in front of an empty desk. Stay classy US Air.
@USAirways can't seem to find the pilots for our 6pm flight, never seen anything like it before #drunkpilots http://t.co/Zira2z3UDc
@united can you please tell me where United flies to from Sydney Australia - pref Asia Pac or US as I have a voucher to redeem.
@united resolved and im sick and tired of waiting on you. I want my refund and I'd like to speak to someone about it.
@AmericanAir Yes, talked to them. FLL says is at central. Central says is at FLL and here we go again. I'm betting this will go 6 mths
@USAirways I NEED TO *SPEAK* TO SOMEBODY ABOUT A RESERVATION. As in talk to a human being. Yet your computer system puts the phone down on
@AmericanAir @cnnbrk she tried they are not doing anything said they would talk to stewardess about serving drunks drinks how does that help
@USAirways I made a reservation online but I didn't receive any confirmation email. My bank said the transaction went through. Can u help?
@JetBlue Start including PTO in your getaway packages and I'm all in
@AmericanAir: my brother's flight into DFW was Cancelled Flightled yesterday. Are you flying from ONT to DFW today?

@AmericanAir thanks for the canned reply.
@VirginAmerica WTF is happening in PDX Late Flight March such that one way from SFO is ~$550?
@SouthwestAir next up: enforcing your boarding procedure.
@AmericanAir I know this is probably a no but is there a way to get a cheaper airfare ticket if the flight is leaving in a few hours? üôè
@SouthwestAir @nelsjeff, 3.5 hrs. Late Flightr (no human interaction), ended up $'ing a completely new flight - so last flight out didn't sell out.
@AmericanAir Thank you.
@JetBlue I've spoken 2/emailed JB team and explained situation. Didnt seem to matter to anyone other than me. I guess I just expected more.

@united it's done.  If you do something to make up for it I'll tweet that too.
@AmericanAir I can hardly believe it! Bundle up and stay warm! üòâ
@AmericanAir the dinner and called me "hon". Not the service I would expect from 1st class.  #disappointed

@SouthwestAir thank you!
.@AmericanAir Alright prove it: (1/3) 3 days ago, I sat on a plane at JFK for 3 hrs, deplaned for 3 more, and when I re-boarded...
@united this is not true. Gate agents 100% caused this. And we're not helpful. Thanks for making me miss connection!! http://t.co/xAIzW2isml
@VirginAmerica How can I watch the #Oscars2015 on my JFK-&gt;SFO flight?
@AmericanAir i tried all day. Have been disconnected due to "heavy call volume."
@united I'd really like to get off of this plane now.
@AmericanAir Flight Get Me Out Of Chicago.
@USAirways got through on the phone. usair Cancelled Flightled her return flights because she missed a flight on her way out. they took care of it
@united (1/2) thanks, but does not answer my question. I want to make a reservation over the phone in Perth, hold for 24hrs, and have family
@SouthwestAir I'm running out of money to keep paying for hotel rooms &amp; food in NYC. You don't help people with $ spent
@AmericanAir You've misunderstood. @USAirways WOULD NOT do a same day flight change for me. The gate agent said, "NO."
@SouthwestAir lets chat about flights to and from BWI and the Carolina area... Can a girl get break? I've had to resort to USAir üòñ 2 a day?!
@United gate announcement states delay due to maintenance yet app says Late Flight arriving aircraft  tell the truth! @unfriendly
@united customers aren't dumb. These revenue based programs will hurt everyone. Not gonna save money like you think
@AmericanAir 4th flight rebooked to is NOT Cancelled Flighted! Woo-hoo. Going to make it to @LaGuardiaAir
@USAirways been on hold for 45 minutes. Is there a better time to call? This is getting ridiculous
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/HovuAIsG16‚Äù WTF üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
@united customer service is the WORST. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold.
@SouthwestAir not sure why we are still here in Dallas.  Plane has been at gate for 30 min.  No update at all.  Flight 1140, poor service.
@JetBlue Just signed up for TrueBlue and booked a flight but keep getting an error when I try to link it to my TB account. What's the deal?
@SouthwestAir I was helped by a nice lady at PHX checkin. I spent 4 hours on hold in 24 hours, so might want to look at efficiency there.
@USAirways tell reservations to rebook me from 5080 to 5129
@USAirways Storm or no storm, your customer service is a joke. 6 hour wait time to speak to someone? I will never fly your airline again.
@USAirways I'm enjoying my flights so far! You're doing a great job. Today's been tough, so thanks for making my flights comfortable.
@AmericanAir is the new 9:45 time confirmed or it may get Cancelled Flightled? Traveling with kids, need to be certain. Thx
@united you guys are awesome! Thanks!
@JetBlue no they offered the flight (4/19), I paid, then they changed it.This is the 2nd  time you have done this to me. ruins cruise plans
@united landed at 9:40pm and have been standing waiting for bags that were loaded plane side..why isn't the crew here#tiredcustomer
@USAirways And it's 3:22 with no sign of boarding.... Can I please get another update?
@united seriously? 45 min on the plane at bhm and now 30 min in baggage and still no bags? #worstairlineever
@USAirways you keep suggesting people call 800-428-4322 but we just end up on hold for hours. You seriously don't have a better method?!
Spend 1 HOUR on hold with @USAirways .
@USAirways no wonder you are the lowest rated airline in america. #shameful #USAirways
@SouthwestAir, sev ppl im my office received an apology and 2k. FF miles for this delay, only apologize to select ppl? I got nothing..
@USAirways I've been on hold for 36 mins and counting cause you charged my credit card for bag but provided no receipt and said error. Awful
@united Call customer service and of course they just say "theres nothing we can do" and then offer a transfer and disconnect the line.
@SouthwestAir, on #unscheduled aircraft change, please have a better system in place, not worth the paid upgrade. #REFUND
@united I'm in Denver, my bag is in San Jose. See something wrong here.
@AmericanAir My chariot tonight. From this angle it looks like a 787, no? http://t.co/3ZZKQWWbJz
@JetBlue yes of course, before I left the airport. I kept looking but claim is still open.
@united When will you have special promotions for flights departing Newark, NJ to St. John's, Antigua?
@united who can tell me where they are?
@USAirways fuck you.
@AmericanAir cannot understand how you are part of oneworld all other member treat their customers fairly #tcf #oldplanes #damageluggage
@USAirways stop Cancelled Flighting flights over and over and not provide any real help to your customers. #strandedinnashville

@united unhappy with your new mileage rules :( - was my main reason to keep flying united. Will have to take my business elsewhere
@united yes, but they still don't know where it is.  I've been told it might be on a flight, but now no one can confirm it.
@united Life goal: complete ‚úîÔ∏è
@USAirways your delayed flight out of Wilmington made me miss my flight out of Charlotte. Figure out how to take off and arrive on time.

Hey @JetBlue, that's a sexy tattoo you got there on your left engine. #Jetbae http://t.co/Ox4w6KtsGI
@AmericanAir fly my child
@united On top of this, a CSR went ahead and hung up on me after I called United to discuss this.
@united I'm not a child. I'm someone who has an issue with flying and prepares ahead of time to reduce the distress caused by planes. You
@united thanks! Makes sense. Just annoying that it can't be determined better.
@SouthwestAir is Flight 3113 OMA&gt;DEN on 2/21 actually Cancelled Flightled? Been on hold for over an hour and your website says conflicting messages
@USAirways on hold 3 hours !!!!!! What's the number to speak to someone this is unacceptable I need to change flights
@united it's Late Flight... I'm tired and understandably edgy for trying to catch my flight. I wasn't chipper, but I def was not rude.
@USAirways has the worst customer service line.  I've called them 8 times today and not once was I able to talk to a real human being.
@united why are you charging people to see the freaking flight map? https://t.co/AgPb45v8wt
@USAirways Spoke on the phone 3 or 4 times, but no resolution. I'm still waiting to get my money back but now prices are jacked up
@AmericanAir so we have a Cancelled Flightled flight in about twelve hours. Maybe we'll have heard from an AA rep at that point.
@SouthwestAir LUV! your new Luv Television Commercials. Traveled on your airline last year return trip from NYC...#feltthelove
@USAirways. On phone hold for 30+ mins trying to speak to an agent. Can't change reservation online. Sigh. #badcustomerexperience
@AmericanAir Still waiting news about my bags 48hrs already happened and this company don't give to the passengers any certain information
@SouthwestAir arrangements to reimburse me for the rental I had to get?
@VirginAmerica Is flight 0769 out of LGA to DFW on time?
@SouthwestAir was wondering is there a reason why customer service is so busy? Been on hold past few days for many hours No answer Help plz
@AmericanAir my key point of confusion is whether I can make this change even though the initial Flight Booking Problems was on US Airways metal?
@SouthwestAir Your crew on 4028 tonight was outstanding. God bless them and the medically trained passengers on board.
@AmericanAir leave us stranded, send baggage with important medication to different city for 4days&amp;apologise with a $50 voucher. appalling.
@united FLT 3444 delayed because of maintenance - that's fixed but can't board because flight crew didn't stay in boarding area #fail
@VirginAmerica has getaway deals through May, from $59 one-way. Lots of cool cities http://t.co/RPdBpX3wNd #CheapFlights #FareCompare
@AmericanAir  To add, I have to get up to go to work tomorrow am.  I don't like having to wait up until 12 or Late Flightr.  CS sucks.
@SouthwestAir  I look forward to those direct flights to California to see my family more often. Thank you @MichaelBColeman #byebyeusairline
@VirginAmerica - can you tweet me the Cancelled Flight/chng fee for a flight? or can I rebook under one of your affiliates? If so, who are afiliates?
@SouthwestAir can I use points to book a rental car?
@SouthwestAir we checked in right at 24hr mark. Boarding C group with kids ages 6&amp;8 dnt want to be split. What sld we do?
@JetBlue @SouthwestAir @VirginAmerica @AmericanAirBR download jeokoo the American app for air travelers
@VirginAmerica How about some free drinks on the flight back for the free promo?
@USAirways I paid for my seat.  I expect to be able to use my full seat
@AmericanAir thanks! Flight 2160 today. Great crew!
@JetBlue done, thank you!
@united. ..I received on other flights. #united  truly breaks guitars. #unitedbreaksguitars #wantmymoneyback
üòí "@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/K66SRFnw77‚Äù
@AmericanAir thx for the apology.   A commitment to fix your broken system would be better.  Actually fixing it would be better still.
@AmericanAir How are you going to compensate all of whose days/plans have been ruined because of the AA3490 delay/pending Cancelled Flightlation?
@AmericanAir flight 3056 DFW still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded - still waiting
@united 4595. We are now going back to the gate b/c of something overheating after sitting out here for 3+ hours.Love United but this stinks

@AmericanAir You sent me a cheque today which can‚Äôt be paid into a UK bank account. VERY annoying!
@JetBlue well lucky I only fly JB..I guess I would be even more squished on any other airline üòû
@JetBlue How is it possible the only way to contact your fraud department is mailing a physical letter? No telephone? No email? REALLY??
@AmericanAir thanks for the update

@SouthwestAir make this delay go away. Maybe upgrade me and Kats seats. We are headed to Columbus.
@united need assistance to change flight to get to an ailing parent..have flight leaving Tuesday need to change ASAP to sooner #custserv
@AmericanAir The issue is the lack of consideration of an announcement made so Late Flight when the gate agent had been there for over an hour.
@JetBlue I do not want to deal with your customer service agents with no practical knowledge.Provide me with a direct contact.
@VirginAmerica View of downtown Los Angeles, the Hollywood Sign, and beyond that rain in the mountains! http://t.co/Dw5nf0ibtr
@SouthwestAir  Poor customer service displayed over the weekend during the storm. I was stuck on the tarmac for 2.5 hours with no answer!
@united I would love if someone could get me back to Austin tonight and I do not wish to wait til tomorrow morning.
@JetBlue Awww thank you B6! Glad to hear it!  Made my day! &amp; one last question do you have any idea what tail is operating flt 606 2maro? :)
@united to speak to a real person to get this resolved politely and efficiently. (2/2)
@JetBlue what maintenance?  The flight landed from Jamaica, has to go through security then get to term 3 then cleaned then board
@JetBlue any way to get 2 ppl on standby list for flight 1970 FLL to BOS. Trying to find way home.
@united + besides, no small degree of self-interest. We take that route several times a year &amp; would hate to be in that situation.
@united our 1 layover itinerary was swapped for a 3 layover itinerary - really?!?
@USAirways I'm glad you're sorry that I'm homeless for the night. Makes me feel secure.
@JetBlue she's standing here on her cell no announcements no info #thismosaicnothappy
@SouthwestAir  we understand air delays which are out of your control, terrible telephone support, apps and online access that do not work??
@AmericanAir @elwoodblues77 I'm sure he understands the rules but you guys just have zero customer service. Staff your damn counters!
@AmericanAir pls help. This is seriously beyond ridiculous.
RT ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/FRAqDPKyga‚Äù @hellobrittNEY_
@united looks like today will be my 6th consecutive delayed flight from you...do I win a prize??? @Southwest Air why don't you fly to SBA? üò≠
@USAirways and @AmericanAir aren't as merged as the marketing departments would have us believe. Maybe @Delta or @united can get me home?
@JetBlue what's the easiest way to get a ticket receipt? Can I get one at check in or can I get one online? Thanks!
@SouthwestAir husband on hold 2.5 hrs, got disconnected!New wait 30 min. Can't confirm res due to the fact he booked on line! Nuts!

@united U blow
@United flight delayed-no one remembered to turn the heat on flight 559 leaving ORD-seriously???
@VirginAmerica I was really looking forward to my flight. can you let me know when it will be rescheduled? #diehardvirgin
.@JetBlue thanks for making an effort. Credit where credit is due: flight 795 delayed 5 hours instead of 8 hours. #fwiw #loweredexpectations

@VirginAmerica As one of the travelers affected by the Boston storm, I'm shocked at Virgin's complete apathy toward their customers.
@united yes. Houston Int'l, Bush.
@AmericanAir @PatrichRuben no, profit maximization is your top priority. Nothing else even registers for you dinosaurs
@AmericanAir @USAirways outbound flight: 2 hour delay b/c air traffic &amp; 2 gate changes dividend miles member gets no email or text updates
@usairways Why are we waiting 40 min so far for our luggage??? #wannagohome
Without notifying though? ‚Äú@AmericanAir: @krescate We don't like Cancelled Flightling flights, Kim, but weather has not played nice with us."

@SouthwestAir she's still stranded in DC. Sat until 3:30am with 100 other kids. They were starving, and exhausted.
@AmericanAir are you anticipating weather-reLate Flightd Cancelled Flightations for afternoon departures out of AUS today?
@united I've been doing this for 15 years and I've never had this many issues with any other airline.
@JetBlue that selfie was extreme.
@usairways Yes. Works in Firefox. Can do everything but finish purchase. Button turns gray, never submits. For a couple weeks now.
@USAirways now you just hang up on me. I‚Äôm starting to think this is personal!
@SouthwestAir what's yall corporate number bc yall are not trying to accommodate me at all!!!
@SouthwestAir again another ride SW employee that printed out boarding passes. Deficiency in training obviously
@united any news?
@united You suck. Flight delayed equipment probs again. Miss connection by 2 minutes and you won't let us on even though it's at the gate.
@SouthwestAir to start daily #B737-700 flights from #Washington Reagan to #FtLauderdale on 8AUG #avgeek
@united your overall experience of flying is not friendly
@united recent services have been very bad. My NC trip was aweful. Very disappointed and never again.
@USAirways I did, but it won't help.. Can't believe you wouldn't take full fare for first class and gave away to Platinum Member.. Profits?
@AmericanAir.If I miss saying goodbye to my friend cause of your crappy service I swear you will never hear the end of it.#AmericanAirlines
@SouthwestAir CEO discusses possibilities of NHL Vegas arena naming rights http://t.co/t3E4SH5xNg @SMUSportMgt #sportsbiz
@AmericanAir I have almost 3 million miles w u so I am loyal to u.  When r u going to reciprocate?  What a joke
@united enough already with the poor service, old planes, ridiculous routing. 1k and time to find a new airline with status match.
@JetBlue we would have been up in the air by now. Now our new plane we've been redirected to has mechanical errors aka more delays 2/3
@united I will! On @AmericanAir @SouthwestAir @Delta or @JetBlue  all of which will be getting my business. #unfriendlyskies #unbelievable
@AmericanAir daughter record loc. is KYBILC. She is traveling with 3 y.o. and needs to be in adjacent seats, not across isle.
@SouthwestAir can @Sagerooski &amp; I use your luggage scale to measure our weight loss? One scale for each foot @ home is not accurate anymore.
@SouthwestAir On hold for two hours and it timed-out on me. Great system you got there.
@JetBlue Thank you for opening the conversation.  I hope you can make it right.
@USAirways @AmericanAir Can you bring guinea pigs in small pet carrier onboard your flights?
@AmericanAir Aww Thanks AA..DFW was on GMA up here this AM..so i understand ..Btw A.A is my Airline when im able to trv..Love you guys.:)
@united nonrefundable, hence I wrote $200! Doesn't make sense for my 150 credit. #nothanks
@united I assume that would be for the other 300 people who have been let down by United? What's worse is plane is here but crew can't fly!!
@united thank YOU for your kindness. Your agents went above &amp; beyond to get my stranded family home.
@JetBlue ha ha! Can I get a wake up call at boarding time please?  Large coffee, extralight extra sweet please!
@USAirways @AmericanAir Flying from Orlando to Philly to Charlotte to Lynchburg. Saw advisory re Philly. Wld like to fly from Orl to Char
@AmericanAir I understand that, but I'm not even being put on hold - it says "try again Late Flightr, goodbye".
@USAirways WTF is going on with the 1:30 from DC to BOS? Twice we go back back to the gate after leaving for the runway? Total BS.
@AmericanAir no response to DM or email yet.  customer service?
@JetBlue he loved the #natural #beefjerky snacksüòâ
last trip on @AmericanAir ... Poor customer service 3 trips in a row! @Delta here I come!
@americanair Can you tell me where my luggage is? I was on flight 1644 SNA to DFW and my flight to MKE was Cancelled Flightled, so got rebooked to ORD
@southwestair,  kudos to your rep "Patricia" at gate B11 this Sunday morning at #Chicago #Midway #MDW,‚Ä¶ http://t.co/MmCWkqp2gy
@AmericanAir did that yesterday. On the phone with them now
@JetBlue @CinziannaP thank you! I like the quick response on Twitter!
@JetBlue  What are your rules on checked baggage and carry ons from SLC to SJO?
@United will not have to honor absurdly low mistake fares.http://t.co/2Z3Jv73IlW v√≠a @usatoday
@USAirways now what? You Cancelled Flightled my flight again... Are you paying for my hotel?
@united This is NOT a local UNITED number for Malaysia   0011 800-55558000. What is your local United Airlines here in Kuala Lumpur ( KUL )?
@united I unfortunately didn't get her name :( she was not nice!
@USAirways Thanks for ruining my last night of vacation because I have to worry about my flight because y'all don't have record of it
@united A change fee of $200. Same exact flight from ATL-HOU is $165. Why a charge of $574? The math doesn't add up.
@VirginAmerica just got on the 1pm in Newark home to LA. Your folks at EWR are incredible #letsgohome
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/ar0VayLmFc‚Äù Really Jet Blue? Lmao
@AmericanAir seems like queue times are very high, in Q waiting for an agent 4 almost  an hour.Flight got Cancelled Flightled. http://t.co/sDm2wvR3zr
@united where is my flight voucher?
@united UA1565 IAH -&gt; SJO is delayed by like 1.5 hours. Crazy!
@AmericanAir you wont allow calls? My husband has a ticket but it looks like all the seats are taken? I cant even call.
@SouthwestAir Hi-My flight (BNA to LGA) was Cancelled Flighted this morning--#1814. Looks like other flights out of BNA are taking off. Any chance?
@SouthwestAir I saw ppl were winning tickets still, how do we win some?
@united Do we know why UA5282 is delayed x2)? This is getting crazy. I've already had 2 overnight delays. #UnitedAirlines
@USAirways - who do I call to use credit fm. prev. cxl tix that can't be rebooked online?Rep I called quoted me $1k higher than the website.
@united #UnitedAirlines wont wait 10min for fam w 2yr old connecting. flight leaves early instead for airport that is planes last stop today
@united This link in your tweet goes to someone's internal email -&gt; http://t.co/ZksX79itdN...... Probably one of your 3rd party IT contracts
@AmericanAir @carlw1980 I have followed and dm'd you. . . Please respond to my concern too. Really disappointed with customer service.
@SouthwestAir will the Daytona 500 be available on free TV?
@USAirways this is so unacceptable. I'm going for the day. Now most of my day will be sitting on your plane. Not to mention there is no air
@AmericanAir Yes, thanks for checking. Very cramped, but got on &amp; made it safely. Flying back tomorrow at 1pm. http://t.co/CSddCCMvbD
@USAirways usually "sorry" doesn't involve moving people to middle seats and removing them from upgrade lists. Guess that's a club perk.
@USAirways well I thought they had hours ago but just found out that no I do not have a seat
@USAirways - 53 minutes on hold for a reservation?
@SouthwestAir you're going to compensate us for the two plane changes in Atlanta right?
@AmericanAir On hold for 20 mins and then used the call back service only to have an agent call me and put me on hold forever-anyone there?
@SouthwestAir I'm getting leathery from the heat on 4251 before I even get to Vegas....
@SouthwestAir Looking forward to flying once again with #SWA on Friday! The #LUV airline. #DTW #MDW #TUS
@JetBlue she hung up before I can get name. She took no accountability for keeping me on hold +20min. Next rep was not able to track name
@united I'm not sure why I expected anyone to be here http://t.co/bnFlHPXtmw
@JetBlue would love to respond to link but supervisor tore ticket up and refused to give me names and hid her badge from me
@JetBlue it's time for our #brandmance 2 go #UpWhereWeBelong https://t.co/KtAWbiUUro
@SouthwestAir if you guys fuck this up again  I will never forgive you
@united very missed daughter suppose to dpt ORD @5:59pm - dpted  8:30pm -checked week's average for UA3645 -shameful!  7 day average 7:54pm
@SouthwestAir the ball has been dropped. My snowboard will not be making it to my destination. #totalfail #letdown
@AmericanAir you keep returning my call and hanging up when I answer? Help reFlight Booking Problems a flight!
@Jetblue first airline to use #applepay in flight #airlines
@united well, you can't fix me missing my buddies 30th bday because of negligence but you can attempt to make up for it.
@SouthwestAir like kelsey said, really bad spot for locals. Do you know how long it takes to find parking then walking over to the bellagio?
@SouthwestAir  no such thing as a free flight. Gonna be spending $100 on board rental bc #swa couldn't get my baggage to greenville w me.
@SouthwestAir thank you. See u next wednesday in FLL. Save me some peanuts
@AmericanAir 2 hours now!  No I'm not patient.  Why don't you have a call back feature or pay someone to answer the phone, not tweet #onhold
@JetBlue Are departing flights from Boston heavily delayed? Flying out tomorrow morning ...
@USAirways Im researching a flight &amp; noticed a small issue w/class of service between your site &amp; other sites. Could Reservations help me?
@united Back at the Denver airport and ready for round two today. Ready to get home!
@VirginAmerica is there special assistance if I travel alone w/2 kids and 1 infant? Priority boarding?
@united not about being on my way or impatience on my part...it's about you being untruthful and not having proper systems in place
@united space. Doctors' notes and everything. And on my first trip they lost my first suitcase. Among other issues- not pleased with #united
@united Why is my time less important to you?  #StrandUsInDenver #HourAndTenMinuteDelay #FlightFail
@SouthwestAir in flight wifi + @TMobile wifi calling makes for the best combination. Who doesn't love texting 40,000 feet in the air :D
@USAirways disappointment? Making own arrangements for me &amp; my sleeping toddler with zero assistance from USAir is maddening.
@SouthwestAir my bday was yesterday and my girl gave birth to my first born and I couldn't get a courtesy flight change from Lynn... THANKS!
@USAirways lol thanks to you we had to switch to American http://t.co/Sl6BDRXfN8
@united Death in the family cannot make flight tomorrow. Phone rep quoted $440 per person fee, which is almost the cost of ticket. Help?
@united I guess you have to "follow" me in order for me to send you a DM.. I tried and it won't send.
@SouthwestAir I keep getting disconnected after choosing the option "unused travel funds" on your automated customer service line! SOS
@JetBlue waiting at HPN on plane more than an hour since landing b/c of no gate, please get us off this plane!
@united all goods, I'll call tomorrow, thanks.
@USAirways Already tried. How about Conf # via DM
@united Don't ask me to be patient without offering something in return.
@AmericanAir do you offer group pricing discounts by any chance?
@USAirways if I have Dividend Miles credit card &amp; I used it to book my flight is one bag free?
@United my flight from MCO has been delayed &amp; scheduled to arrive after my connection departs. What options do I have?
@SouthwestAir Any possible chance of SWA bringing back service between LGA-BWI? It would make it much easier to connect to the west coast.
@USAirways you say to call travel agency and they say we cant refund because usairways didnt accept this.
@USAirways How long before departure do gates stay open? Will I make my connecting flight 1861 to RDU from flight 894???
@USAirways I just hope that pilot had a good day off
@AmericanAir Nicest people ever flight to Chicago.Thanks David Deane &amp; Norma Sedholm for making me feel comfortable ‚úàÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏è
@united seriously? 2-4 hrs to get bags from IAD intl arvls to carousel 2 for custs w/Cancelled Flightled connects? I understand irrops but ridiculous!
@AmericanAir I'm going to speak with customer service at the airport tomorrow morning and see what my options are. I need a flight tomorrow
@JetBlue thank you
@united flying out of STL Saturday where they are expecting ice &amp; snow. When should we start looking for travel waivers? Thanks!
@USAirways the least you could do is make up for what you have caused. You are ruining people's memories! You should be ashamed!
@AmericanAir any idea why flight 5392 from HSV to DFW tomorrow Cancelled Flightled about 45 minutes ago?
@united the nightmare continues... http://t.co/TsvgbrL15f
@AmericanAir how about some rampers at gate b40 dfw?   Waiting to be marshaled in
@United many people on Ua6318 are going to miss connections due to long wait time in SFO tarmac. Seriously u can't find an empty gate?
@USAirways that's it?!?!?
@AmericanAir sorry so Late Flight, responded to your DM.
@united all day travel. #swag #ijustwanttosleep
@united what happened to flight status map? It was so cool..
@USAirways @msscottwg  "That's unusual" means we screwed up but will never admit to it!  #GoingForGreatnessFAIL
@AmericanAir thnkx bt dont help now we will need to go WAY out of OUR way to get where we NEED to be for the $ u charge this sux #neveragain
@USAirways flight 4524 delayed for 2 hours for a deadhead crew.  Lets make 150 paying customers wait ...that is great service #USAirways
@AmericanAir just need to know why it wasn't done like it was promised it would yesterday
@JetBlue Whoa! No tag and you still saw my tweet. Flight 105 JFK to Chicago. Trying to get home to see my little brother wrestle!
@SouthwestAir So there were 134 early-bird check-ins, because I was told there were no flythroughs? Good flight, otherwise ~
@SouthwestAir Happily! But you need to follow me in order for me to DM you
@USAirways I'm not patient. I'm annoyed. If you can't book this travel online, then you shouldn't make people wait on the phone.
@SouthwestAir 2 wounded vets stuck. Hv trouble with agent help. On hold and no answer on Twitter. Pls respond
@united a plane took our gate and now we're just waiting in a lot at DIA
@united So what does someone with severe anxiety do when the one person who can help him isn't next to him?
@united has unrivalled access to #California with flights to the U.S. from 7 UK airports, with nonstop or one-stop connections year-round
@united Lost bag process is broken. Agent promised they'd call &amp; hold my bag when found. Now they're waking me at 3am w/ delivery. #fail
@United I'd like to thank and recognize Terri P at Dulles for going out of her way to get me back on my Raleigh flight
@USAirways US 728/Feb 21 Kim Y says: leaving on 15 minutes once paperwork is done. Wheels up ~ 1.5 hours Late Flightr.
@USAirways I love how just to give feedback to this link I have to fill out all my personal info on a form.  You guys are the best :)
@SouthwestAir open seating is like an open marriage, there's so much love for strangers!
@USAirways @stephenrodrick Your team needs to build capacity
@AmericanAir how do I redeem a travel voucher for a flight if I can't reach a travel agent by phone? My hold expires in 24 hours
@SouthwestAir How to I rebook on-line when it keeps telling me that it's a reserv number for a past date (this morning)? Holding for 2hrs.
@USAirways no warm weather hubs means no Mexico for us.  And I can't go anywhere else since you lost my bags. I hope you attempt to rectify
@united that I would get on early enough to not have to green tag. but no go. if not for Otis I would be still sitting at ORD
@JetBlue can you let me know status of flight #454 PBI-JFK delayed 2.5hours now on board problem with hatch..
@JetBlue weather where?  It's 60 in SFO and flight 834 is still on time to boston.
@united considering it. Currently gold on @delta. Why should I make the jump for an upcoming flight from SFO to Singapore?
@united yes, I've been waiting for four hours and no one has been able to help me.
@united gates were DEFINITELY NOT FULL. We were parked and wheels were chocked. Customer service called it an "UNMET ARRIVAL"!!
@AmericanAir I'm flying with your competitor today, starts with an U and ends with D. I will never make that mistake again. #americanforlife
@JetBlue @martysg you *know* how I love you, JB, but honestly, when you have complex feedback, those pull-down sub-option forms=maddening.
@AmericanAir it wasn't really about the delay. It was more about being told the engine needed to be troubleshot.  Makes a person paranoid.
@united ^GJ I will. You have to agree that 7+ hours Late Flight for arrival is unacceptable. I only hope and pray my bag is here.
@USAirways churn rate increasing by the second
@USAirways but i bougth mc caren to jfk with same agency and delta airways . Delta refund money but usairways doesnt accept to refund
@USAirways can you explain why I am on hold over an hour .Other than I'm dumb and should be using a different airline #wth
@JetBlue Not trying to make you look bad, on your website it says: "Due to weather in the Charleston, NC" Its actually in SC, not NC
@SouthwestAir Lastly, for a company that's trying to put the love in flying it would be nice to have someone personally address my concerns.
@united I would like to know what's going on before his current flight lands.
@JetBlue deal!
@JetBlue how do I get a copy of my last flight showing original time and delay? I need it for work. Thanks!
@USAirways Your CLT baggage crew deserves a #kudos. I had to run to make my connection. And my bags still made it! #CustomerService
@USAirways 5203 and we're just sitting 20 feet from an open gate
@united !!!!! YAAYY!!! YAY PROM!!!! http://t.co/DXicoyioxF
@USAirways please follow me so I can DM you about something
@SouthwestAir You guys are just being disrespectful at this point... learned my lesson about this airline
@united have an employee at the gate 15min before boarding like u expect ur customers to. Be a competent company like ur rivals
@AmericanAir  Dear American, when did 2 hour hold times become the industry standard?  Have you heard of additional staffing during weather?
@USAirways I am in meetings in California and have no luggage!!
@united By the way, a simple apology goes a long way, even if it's a hollow one. It's obvious that you don't care about me or my well-being,
@JetBlue @Amagrino will you cover the cost of my car service waiting time?!
@USAirways and it still says it's on time on your website btw
@AmericanAir thanks for your apology but it's a bit Late Flight. Cancelled Flighting a flight more than 24 hrs in advance due to weather is ridiculous. We
@AmericanAir is non existent and I will take this as far as needed.Why hide behind a corporate logo? Provide a number #tcf #useless #amateur
@united The DEN b44 agent (9:30am) was amazing. The MPAgent at check in? She sucks. @seanMFmadden @PeterStraubMMA @jmercadoMMA @TonySimsMMA
@USAirways But nope!  Apparently this is the way you guys do business!  I guess I'm flying southwest and her blue from now on.
@AmericanAir I'm great thanks keep up the good work
@united flight UA3774 after two delays. just Cancelled Flightled and no more flights to Norfolk that aren't booked. Renting a car.
@USAirways last name Pordes
@united My contact stuff is in the bag and I'm legally blind. This is so messed up.
@united flt 912. Capt Herman is amazing! Came out before flight to play "ask the captain anything." Wonderful ambassador to the airline!!
@united JP - DM message who? Can't get a DM through to @united
@AmericanAir please DM me a way to get in touch with someone that can help. I'm platinum AA and considering quitting AA BC of this.
@SouthwestAir By the way the flight number was 1703, please feel free to fact check my complaints about leave time &amp; baggage time.
@SouthwestAir how oh how do we get tickets! ?!
@united Oh, we are sure it's not planned, but it occurs absolutely consistently, it's usually the only YYJ flight that's Cancelled Flightled daily.
@VirginAmerica thank goodness!! Also, see you friday, nwk&gt;sf.. BOOM!
@USAirways How do I redeem my pass to the admirals club? I have 1 free visit with my barclay card membership. And can I bring a companion?
@AmericanAir yes but we HAVE TO GET HOME TOMORROW!!!! Please
@AmericanAir do you know if there is wifi on this flight? If so how much is it? Thank you :-)
@USAirways I ask for reimbursement maybe miles added to my account for my inconvenience and for the money that I had to spend
@USAirways @AmericanAir  best u could do-I might get my refund within 2 billing cycles. Months of u guys asking for another chance. I'm done
@united Additionally, my husband paid for tv service &amp; it stopped working about halfway through the flight.
@SouthwestAir y airline I fly with, but haven't seen anything like this yet!
@United are you able to see if there are seats open on another flight??
@united tried to and got through the whole 2,000 characters and I was not even done.
@AmericanAir Flight 236 was great. Fantastic cabin crew. A+ landing. #thankyou #JFK http://t.co/dRW08djHAI

@SouthwestAir  THANK YOU for your awesome flights. Sweetheart got screwed on @FlyFrontier, managed to scramble and get a SW plane today. !!!
@AmericanAir How do I place it on hold and complete payment? I don't see any way to do that from my reservations page.
@AmericanAir why do I have to wait for 2 hours to talk to someone when you changed my flight?
@AmericanAir I still can't get through to change my flight. This is really important plz help!
@AmericanAir my flight tomorrow is Cancelled Flighted you guys just keep letting me down
@SouthwestAir no worries. You're doing the best u can. Already Cancelled Flighted my biz trip. Still $LUV you! -RR 1079871763

@SouthwestAir Any ETD for SWA1004 from PHL? Appears delayed but no info available at gate.
@USAirways how about checking the plane before having everyone board the plane? #pissed
@united So they didn't drop my bag overnight &amp; now I'm leaving for a week. This is why you were supposed to hold on to the bag....
@JetBlue yer deals never seem to include NYC--&gt;PDX or NYC--&gt;PGH...wish they did!
@united bummer but thank you for the quick response
@united and the fact that we were treated disrespectfully and lied to by members of your airline that claims to strive for the best
@AmericanAir the original receipt lists my flight cost as $89ish, and doesn't reflect the use of a voucher
@USAirways That's clever. Its clear you need more agents. 94 min hold and counting. Flex workforces are highly possible in 2015
@JetBlue Was nice to see your Veterans Advantage Program at the gate on Sunday @ MCO.Keep up the good work at  JetBlue
@united flight delayed...again...every time. "Maintenance issues"
@USAirways that's why u guys are my #1 choice.
@JetBlue flight 577  fll to sfo. No speed line even though I paid for it. No coffee on flight. and my non stop now has an unscheduled stop
@united @NY_NJairports Only at Newark can you land 15 minutes early but lose all that time waiting on tarmac for a gate.
@JetBlue any concern about Cancelled Flightled flights due to the cold weather in NJ Saturday am? Do you Cancelled Flight at 0 degrees?
@SouthwestAir can't speak with customer service for 2hours, still on hold! Do you guys work?#nogood
@united Q: Just purchased ticket to #Hawaii for trip in Late Flight-March. Does this mean we will acquire miles based on price or distance flown?
@united It appears there are six flights to Calgary tomorrow is this correct?
@AmericanAir DONE!! thank you so much!!
@AmericanAir @pbpinftworth iPhone 6 64GB (not 6 plus)
@JetBlue why was Flight 1856 delayed to Buffalo ?  It‚Äôs a direct flight and the plane is at the gate.
@USAirways been trying to talk with a dividend miles rep for 2 days now. I have been holding for over 2 hours each day. What are my options?
@JetBlue Finally starting to come out. 40 minutes and no communication is not acceptable. Letting me down today.
@JetBlue really caring??
@USAirways so I still need to stay on hold? http://t.co/04SDytT7zd
@USAirways thank you! I tried that and they said they didn't have it. Anywhere else to try?
@united if I was rebooked do I have to pick up my luggage?
@SouthwestAir better travel photos:My Kindle e-book Easy Tips guide http://t.co/7dM2J8H97M:http://t.co/xeDeckGMW5 http://t.co/frGhglMkqF
@USAirways I had to sit in your kitchen and move stuff around so I had what I needed. I'm extremely disappointed in your service
@AmericanAir so am I going to be homeless or do I have a place to stay tonight? Can you respond to me here so I can go back to sleep?
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/clu5pdPrHP‚Äù :(
@JetBlue #kudos! And we're done and heading to warmer weather!
@AmericanAir you ever wonder why you find yourselves responding to so many customer complaints on twitter? It's because your airline sucks.
@SouthwestAir an entire flight of luggage missing at #dca.  Over an hour and nobody knows anything.
@USAirways @AmericanAir Will you be destroying lives in Eastern @GastonCounty during this lively little event? For profits you will.
@AmericanAir me up in a hotel tonight and expect me to now pay even more money. I don't have that money!! I was supposed to get a call back
@AmericanAir just went to check into flight 24 hr advance, again husband and I are seated separately for 6hr flight! why does this happen??
@JetBlue and The from @WSJ Team to Offer In-#Flight Access to Journal ... - Broadway World http://t.co/AsYqE1tDjp
@united Priceless. United stranded my daughter at O'Hare. United did zero to keep her safe.....alone on a plastic chair for 9h! # United Air
@AmericanAir your gate agents at DFW gate B16 are pathetic tonight.  Terrible communication, stories changing and apathetic
@united yes staff were rude  and unempathetic. I needed jacket and tablet by 4 got at 11. If u take carryons cause plane full.don't lose em!
@united wanted to, but you Cancelled Flightled my tickets.... They were too special i guess even for united.
@SouthwestAir hire more customer service agents. And hour and a half is too long to hold
@USAirways really frustrating to be endlessly waiting at PHL for a ground crew to taxi us in at 10pm at night. Why is this taking so long?!
@SouthwestAir no delay. I pay $777.70 for BS A1 ticket. You boarded flight early. I'm last to board. Now have middle seat. Wasted $$$$!
@AmericanAir so if your genuine, give me your opinion  on what occurred last night 445 fly  from phl, to mia. No assistance at airport
@SouthwestAir flt 648 from Buf to MCO. Conf#FGKXV5. Please also look into reimburse for car 587701925COUNT that I had to Cancelled Flight
@united thanks for the epic service on 863- always a pleasure- outstanding crew http://t.co/trqlpeinzW
@SouthwestAir standing in Las Vegas and our flight says on time, but reps are telling us that all flights to Denver are Cancelled Flightled. HELP
@USAirways My daughter is stranded in charlotte because US Airways Cancelled Flightled her flight tonight.  Completely dissatisfied with @USAirways
@united Nope! I'm on UA 174 that was supposed to leave at 6:47 but are still at the gate. Apparently we are about to pull back and de-ice.
@united What does "Cabin Functionality" mean when I'm taking a customer satisfaction survey?
@JetBlue shut up an turn on the tvs/music
@SouthwestAir can u follow so I can DM a confirmation number I need confirmed to Cancelled Flight?I will call to confirm Monday for refund
@USAirways your customer service is a nightmare. I have been on hold for 1 hour. I'm a platinum member with AA and feel like it's worthless
@united once united's service levels reaches those of Etihad or lets be more realistically Lufthansa then ill consider it again
@USAirways there has been NO one at the Yuma ticket counter for 30 minutes and there are about 30 people in line. Terrible service!!!
@SouthwestAir no her lunch was over by the time she got her call answered
@USAirways she will be reaching out to you! HARDWORKING mom just trying to do her best!
@SouthwestAir  Cancelled Flighted Sunday 9:50AM flight to Dallas..next flight out is Tuesday afternoon. Stranded. #BS #GetMeOuttaHere #SouthwestSucks
.@AmericanAir (2/3) ...I sat on the runway for 4 MORE HRS b4 takeoff (10 hrs Late Flight, 4:30 AM). Pilot plainly stated it was a comp/mech issue.
@united crashed trying to check in.
@AmericanAir Thank you!!!! I will be there to pick her up on time.
@JetBlue CEO battles to please Wall St and flyers - from @NZherald http://t.co/Q4Amiw7FSw
@AmericanAir Next Friday, I'll take AA3074 to LGA.Sat morning, US1951+US874.Do I have to take my bags at LGA or I get them to my final dest?
@united that's fine. I'll take them.
@AmericanAir hahahaha! This is crazy! Well here's to another night at the airport!!
@united the only difference being you are both responsible and in a position to do something about them. Learn from @Delta
@united flight 3763 IAd-Sat. We're on the outdoor track for an hour
@SouthwestAir I think me and my group could use some nice cold drinks once we get in the air...we are all over 21 üòúüòé
@SouthwestAir and Carol Thrower are passengers. Fort Lauderdale airport.
Stop this madness RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/7x9uSbj2FV
@united disappointed that u didnt honor my $100 credit given to me for ur mistakes. Taking my business elsewhere  ‚úåÔ∏èout.
@united - it is possible to make a ticket change via Twitter? Traveling internationally and can't make calls... Thanks in advance!
@united workin on it. Waiting on him to reply.
@SouthwestAir If there are any Imagine Dragons tickets left for tomorrow at @VelourLive here in Utah I would love to go I am available! :)
@USAirways take a look at 1715. All F seats filled, so someone upgraded their friend instead of following rules.
@AmericanAir fantastic thanks! Will try and tweet a photo of the view :)
@united any help is appreciated. That's a LOOONG wait for help on something that's not his fault
.@SouthwestAir glad you appreciate it, it‚Äôll be the last dollar you ever get from me thanks to your wretched customer service
@SouthwestAir what is the status of the bag check area at FFL?
@JetBlue things happen it's ok just wish I was on the beach and not in the airport
@united What are the chances of my flight to EWR from PIT being Cancelled Flighted tomorrow?
@SouthwestAir trying to get anyone on phone. Flt Cancelled Flighted. Please get me to Denver.
@USAirways I'm sick of living in an airport!! #getittogether
@JetBlue do you REALLY think it's okay to sit kids away from parents?! Srsly?! Esp after your landing gear failure?? http://t.co/x6SYW3MDVu
@united the bag is in a state that I didn't travel to and the airports don't fly to each other. Looks like it'll never show
@united seriously what's with the slow #wifi on this flight! If the speed was going to change for the worse then the price shouldn't go up!
@JetBlue appreciate the response Worst part is losing the non refundable hotel in Orlando. Your crew blamed wind! Hoping for no more delays!
@united thanks for the effort. I can get the earliest. Though I will make a complaint for a refund as I am losing one business day tomorrow
@USAirways hell is terrible gate agents. And a three hour wait at the gate.
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flightled my flight, didn't notify me, and I can only rebook by phone, but can't get through to an agent. Epic. Fail.
@united what's a girl gotta do to get a flight name change when SHE bought one for a mean ex boyfriend and needs a girl's trip stat?!
@SouthwestAir Oops...no functioning bathrooms on a fairly full flight?  Hope everyone on 702 from New York can hold it.  Me included.
@SouthwestAir I am genuinely surprised you all don't upgrade people when you Cancelled Flight their flights or at least put them in a comparable spot
@JetBlue you respond to my friend @LisaPal but you can't respond directly to me
@JetBlue thanks for the heads up about the 2 hour delay #sarcasm #patienceiswearingthin #woof
@USAirways epic fail @ CLT ystrdy w/Cancelled Flightled flights. No staff, no communication &amp; no refund for unused portion of tix. Keep it classy guys
@USAirways Do your flight schedules to - from Quintana Roo, Mexico reflect their newly adopted time zone change to EST?
@United is the worst major US airline.  More proof: they're boarding the plane with the outside galley door open in 0 degree weather.  Wtf?
@JetBlue Issue is JFK. Pilot explained once JFK reopens we can get scheduled back there, but why can't we divert to LGA? Closer than ACY!
.@united Will breaking them in somehow make them longer so that they don't cut off the circulation in my legs? #unfriendlyskies
@SouthwestAir On hold waiting to make special accommodations for my mom who is traveling 1 hour and 24 minutes on hold.  Unacceptable!
@SouthwestAir damn weather messing up everything #serenitynow
@AmericanAir won't answer the reservation line!  Nice service.  We may be stuck...
@VirginAmerica Thank you for the follow
@SouthwestAir I've been on hold with customer service for over an hour. Can you help?!
@united Cool. Thank you.
@SouthwestAir super disappointed today. First time we've had to stress and now book a flight on another airline while at the airport
@AmericanAir you delayed me for 15 hours in Chicago and still managed to lose my bag! Really not happy
@JetBlue Are there really no flights from the Bay Area to Chicago anymore? Lame. So lame.
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/tEjrN09tfw‚Äù NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
@usairways @usair   idiots took our plane &amp; gave it to someone else. Fudgers!!!! Flight 799 from Philly to Orlando
@usairways Does anyone know the hold times for USAirways reservations?
@JetBlue that is my point! They are only offering me a flight the next day and expect me to now pay for a hotel because they Cancelled Flightled.
@AmericanAir 3198 to AEX. Is it still going?
@AmericanAir What are Preferred Seats?
.@JetBlue Delete this tweet.
@SouthwestAir when does today's scavenger hunt start? I'm trying to help my little brother win! #DestinationDragons
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/y5qE9HcQzT‚Äù why.
@USAirways ...be found when he checks in. Now no info. Please DM me and help me fix this NOW. (3/3)
@VirginAmerica brought it all the way across the country today I see http://t.co/TKaUyGcPmS
@united great. Looking forward to your response to my DM then
@USAirways yes it landed at 11:40am. Should not take another 12+ hours to go 40 min drive. Was assured I would have this am.
@USAirways ok thank you! Very helpful! This is why you're my favorite airline!
@VirginAmerica Very nicely done. üëè
@JetBlue over 2 hour delay going from NYC to Denver! Come on man!
@united Old school ride home to LAX from Houston #flyingRetro http://t.co/6asuwx3Kv0
@united thanks for nothing. Really?!? 60 minute wait times when I've had to call back 4x. That's 240minute wait times.
@USAirways thanks for letting me know of the 12 hour delay and 2 hours on hold ?
@AmericanAir it that you say is going to help us? Give me a number to call that isn't a recording w a 2 hour wait time!
@SouthwestAir it's pretty stupid and I probably won't fly it again. Plus hearing nightmare stories of overbooked flights.
@united are the miles going to be restructured? Help a silver status brotha out! I thought I was winning with you guys until today lol
@SouthwestAir although I'm not happy you Cancelled Flighted my flight home tomorrow (phx to atl then dca) I am happy on how easy it was to rebook
@JetBlue Great thank you!
@united all good man it isn't your fault that plane is having maintenance issues
@united I'm saying I made the flight but with poor/non-communication, unaccounted for lost time &amp; lots of frustrated flyers standing around
@USAirways how about now getting us the rest of our bags please? We only received 2 of 5. Can you help with that?
@SouthwestAir CEO Gary Kelly, "You all are absolutely my heroes!" #SouthwestRally #BWI #bestemployees #swaculture http://t.co/JTxyHQHfJJ
@JetBlue I know there's no actual 'mile high' club, but surely there's something I can join ;-)
@united WTH be honest with your customers.  This better be the last change or we are driving home.  Has our plane left or not!
@USAirways  Three months and my miles haven't been credited.  No one is going to read the email I sent.
@USAirways that website does not give correct info said my bag was in Miami was in key west the entire time..I got the run around for 2 days
@AmericanAir attended to and corrected my complaints via Twitter. Whoa. This is the brave, new world we live in. Thank you, American Air :)
@SouthwestAir @love_dragonss LAUREN OMG BEST AIRLINE EVER
@SouthwestAir @Imaginedragons please help me and my best friend get tickets to #DestinationDragons we have so much to thank them for....
@united did not get names...Dallas flight and Chicago
@united Brothers luggage was lost on Copa Airlines Flight 635. He's competing Sunday for the 2015 Panamerican Cross Country Cup. Please help
@AmericanAir no one met flight 1081 to LAX to tell passengers where to go or what flights they were rebooked on #badmgmt #AmericanAirlines
@united I'm rebooked now, but the line was 300 people deep.
@USAirways Thanks guys! Got hold of someone. Really awesome service I appreciate it :)
@USAirways the link doesn't work..
@SouthwestAir Hi! Just got my TSA pre-check # &amp; put it in my acct. But it's not on my boarding pass for a flight this p.m.Can it be updated?
@united I will thank you!
@SouthwestAir I can easily get to the Atlanta show, I just need tickets, help?!
@USAirways Thanks but when I asked for a change with no cost for you the only desition was nade by computer. Now is Late Flight
@SouthwestAir has the best customer service!
@usairways you made us miss our flight, first class now I can't even enter the admirals club.  Not happy  dm me to fix this.
@AmericanAir we're still stucked in the airport. #AADelay #AA919
@AmericanAir yet there are plenty of available AA agents at gates nearby who say they are unable to help customers from our flight.
@SouthwestAir to start 2xdaily #B737-700 flights from #OrangeCounty to #Portland OR on 8AUG #avgeek
@SouthwestAir I am just wondering when are you going to open up fares for November?
@SouthwestAir you are the #Official airlines of #DivadaPouch aka #ThePoopQueen http://t.co/XXY2d2iMnP
@AmericanAir is rising like the sun at DCA this morning.  @NATCA members have the best view. #avgeek http://t.co/VAhdekVOKe
@JetBlue I hope your system wasn't hacked cause someone else's passport info was on my reservation &amp; I couldn't get my boarding pass
@USAirways abandoned 40 Boston bound fliers...someone in management needs to #saveface and #showup
@AmericanAir record number is BPDFPP.
@united Booked a flight home over 7 months ago and requested seats together for my fianc√©e and I. We got 2 middle seats. UNACCEPTABLE. The
@USAirways I was told there is no record of my refund.  Can someone please help me. This has been a long day
@JetBlue keep going back and forth with being able to board and then not. But great agents in savannah!
@JetBlue at what point in delays can I take a different flight to my destination?
@united you are the worst. I will avoid you like the plague.
@USAirways Priorities should have been made. Considering a pending snow storm, why delay a flight for an hour &amp; a half? I'd like an answer.
@united I am blown away by stellar #custserv !! Thank you &lt;3 http://t.co/JOrEScfb4x
@united I lost my sunglasses on the flight from OKC to IAH this morning (8am takeoff) .. is there any way to retrieve them?
@united I'm not as sure as you are. http://t.co/HSMpbSF4UF
@VirginAmerica I like the TV and interesting video . Just disappointed in Cancelled Flightled flight when other flights went out to jfk on Saturday .
@united After speaking to a United customer service rep the night before a flight, confirming that everything is ok with your reservation..
@SouthwestAir boarded plane only to be told to get off as it wasn't our plane. Now an hour delay. üò≠üò≠
@JetBlue hotspot free WiFi makes me happy. #jfk #itsthelittlethings
@united you'd learn if you listen to your customers...you do want you want...@VirginAmerica asks their customer what they want
@SouthwestAir Thanks! I know the routes you currently have from Newark. I was just wondering if there was any new ones on the horizon
@SouthwestAir Thank you!
@united Poor cabin luggage service on UA1266 to BOS, I was forced to check in even when there was empty space for bags in the overhead!
@united 1 refused boarding with Nexus. nexus confirmed she should not be refused
@AmericanAir a confirmed flight. I'm so done! Thanks for nothing!
@SouthwestAir following. Thank you.
@united incompetent/rude service today. Missed my connecting flight, then the customer service desk was terrible to me. Really upset w untd.
@united how can your app show arriving aircraft is early but departing flight is delayed due to Late Flight arriving aircraft? @unfriendly
@jetblue fly 2301 delayed do to ice at JFK ... Can I switch to a Late Flightr flight for free
@AmericanAir I'm on #1058 tmrw from CUN DFW. Final dest'n is ORD. Seeing freezing rain in DFW all morning. Should I change my connection?
@USAirways I would be willing to pay anything to change a flight! @AllegiantTravel does not! help!
@AmericanAir gah this is so frustrating! Nobody has my address here in the USA. Where are my bags!?!? So disorganised!!!!!!!!!!!
@united Luckily, I had my disinfectant wipes and did your job for you. You're welcome. #badservice
@AmericanAir why are @USAirways gold forced to pay for an upgrade? Open seats in 1st and not offered to Gold/Sapphire
@USAirways the kind gentleman at the gate tells me to "go left" to get my hotel voucher at the ticket gate. Took about 20min to get there
@USAirways  I just reserved a flight with my companion certificate, where do I mail the certificate for verification???? THX!!!
@USAirways it takes a month?
@JetBlue @DatingRev mco to lag two hour delay and sitting in Tarmac going on 40 minutes with infants crying on plane!! Get us off this plane
@JetBlue you have to service your remote controllers on my flight I watched equalizer (movie) THREE times because my remote was stuck
@SouthwestAir why do you charge so much moving from a full flight to an earlier flight with seats available?  doesn't make sense to me.
@united or @flysaa has lost my baggage‚Ä¶ heard different things from different employees of @united. @flysaa has said nothing.
@USAirways that is certainly not the impression she's under.
@USAirways @AmericanAir @GMA could not have had a worse airline experience. Rude, unhelpful, got yelled atüò≥. @JetBlue need your help
@united that's what I have been told. But refund doesn't really makeup for the inconvenience caused and the missed meeting... Does it?
@AmericanAir on our way now
‚Äú@united: @d_goodspeed We will follow up with our Maintenance team. Thanks for the tweet. ^KP‚Äù THANK YOU!  United Cares!
@AmericanAir will do on another airline that's more accommodating of its customers. Unable to simply change passengers with notice is simply
@united I was able to get a seat on earlier flight sfo to ind.  Can you add me to 6pm ord to IND?
@SouthwestAir INSANE traffic in LA. Trying to call you all to re schedule flight but been on phone for 20 minutes and nothing.
I've been trying to set up my phone interview for days, and hoping the position won't be filled because the link doesn't work. @USAirways
@united sorry, I hate united. i won't get to see my family until Thursday
@united why am I to believe they will help when customer service couldn't? Like I said, I want a number to someone who can fix what you did.
@USAirways no I am trying to get on a plane from Phx to RNO and the gate is saying the flight was downgraded.
@SouthwestAir Times change, I guess. http://t.co/osox9h7fWY
@USAirways 3 hrs on hold. Husband has decided we should sleep in shifts so we don't miss the phone rep. to reschedule
@SouthwestAir oh I see what you did there! Thanks for supporting #PadresST.
@USAirways stuck in Charlotte being treated like a nobody by staff.
@JetBlue flight 16 now sent back to the gate even though the app says its leaving. Anyone have a clue? It's 36 and sunny at JFK
@united still waiting
@united also doesn't help me. I'm a very frequent flier and united premiere gold. Apparently that means nothing.
@AmericanAir yes. No one is answering and I'm on a train
@united Stop pretending you care about the welfare of my daughter. United Airlines had the opportunity to help n failed # United airlines
@united Sandra at ur international checkin counter was rude and offensive.  She commented she didn't care if I complained cuz she had 25yrs
@AmericanAir I understand the need to drain the lavatory fearing freezing but why no policy on checking that before boarding? smh come on...
@united UA6357 needs de-icing! Stat! We've waited our turn...
@USAirways great but that still does not help me..
@united been solved,  they finally picked up the second time I called,  thanks for the response JH!  7:21 to dulles works!
@SouthwestAir 4 hour delay in ATL due to "air traffic control"....love missing an entire day of my vacation #unhappycustomer #mytimeismoney
@united assume those benefits only apply to my own reservation. Any way my partner (on diff res) can use them? Can we combine res?
@JetBlue how can your entire system go down? No IT? Really?
@united I had the worst customer experience at Houston intl airport... Your ground support even for @staralliance members is a nightmare
@SouthwestAir sure thing
@USAirways your a miserable airline and your loss of revenue is a reflection of that.  Go extinct.  A merger only delays the inevitable
@USAirways @AmericanAir how is it possible that someone is drunk they bring a wheelchair for them but you keep serving them
@VirginAmerica @ladygaga @carrieunderwood - Carrie!
@united Usually an issue with Express our of SFO. Positive note: Mainline p.s. was enjoyable.
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/1incNCaV4n‚Äù - wow
@USAirways your chairmans phone is down. what other number can i use?
@USAirways &amp; also that I was told no comps, upgrades, etc. ReFlight Booking Problems is good enough. #usairwaysfail
@united thank you
@united how come I have no baggage updates.
@united seriously? After waiting 2 hours on the plane for my 10:20 flight to leave at 3pm I have to leave the plane? Great. Just great.
@USAirways not to mention the fact that my flight was delayed BECAUSE YOUR COMPUTERS WERE DOWN
@SouthwestAir can I get any kind of update on the delayed flight from Boston to Houston at 7:30? Really need to be back home tonight!
@SouthwestAir Had to pay a $25 fare difference on a change but can't seem to find the receipt for it. How can I get a copy for reimbursement
@JetBlue credit to you for replying.  I‚Äôll look forward to hopefully one of those 103 on my flight home tonight :)
@JetBlue @Cayman_Islands  I know that bar :)  Wish I was there now!
@united yes when I landed.
@united still sucks. I don't understand why you have two cust service agents for a long line at Houston international b gate #unitedsucks
@united FYI, went through this on similar flight last week.
@AmericanAir so the one time we upgrade to first class our luggage was open and now missing valuable items that can't be replaced. #upset
@USAirways will you fly me to somewhere warm? I'm tired of this snow! :(
@united have reported it.  Still in Istanbul at the moment apparently.  On the other plane haha.  Hats off to the pilot!
@AmericanAir change fee = same price of new ticket... Not logical
@USAirways @AmericanAir  is there anyone answering phones today??? Listening to same damn messages for 1:10 minutes
@SouthwestAir all good now. Going to make it to Boston on time. I'm actually on your wifi right now
@USAirways any updates on flight 5202 from ORF to PHL no one at gate...  ;(
@united on 768 to Logan - boarding gong show due to lax carry on enforcement. Bins full of coats = no room for bags. U need a better system!
@AmericanAir I was flying today to MTY Mex at 9:30am but still appear Cancelled Flight, Where can i talk for another flight?
@united haha and you have to clean a plane that was held overnight in a hangar. Sounds lovely. Also don't lie on screensand say it's weather
@united the refund request functionality on http://t.co/5IMDckODfx is broken.i get a time out error.
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/pa7dCjXlzL‚ÄùC'mon famüò≠üò≠ just. No. Ok?
@AmericanAir Kid upset, my staff upset (one accused of stealing fruit!!!!!) mistreatment due to airline policy of an Austic child.
@united 14 hours after landing in #ATL &amp; I still do not have my bags...which means no clothes or makeup!!! #UnitedAirlines #nothappy
@SouthwestAir I tweeted several times last week about flight info during storm, always a timely tweet back.  Thx! üòÑ
@united when I click that link it wants my flight info. I haven't booked a flight yet. I read you waive fees for military, it this true?
@united  I'm on standby for my connecting flight. 1st on the list.  NudgeNudge I'm told there are four slots open. Save it for me.  Please.
@AmericanAir no one received text alerts, automated calls, anything either. Literally no information as to what was happening.
@USAirways  you Cancelled Flightled both my flights and refused to give a voucher despite no flights for 2days. @USAirways #neveragain
@united A refund and flight vouchers or another flight on a different airline at your expense for today. 8 hour drive is very inconvenient
@AmericanAir Great, thanks. Followed.
@AmericanAir glad that you WANTED to help me, but you didn't. Have an agent call me before I rant about shitty service every day
@AmericanAir  thanks for making the worst fly experience ever. Will never book again with your airline. Train your flight attendants better.
@AmericanAir I'm in MEX.  I need to fly to New York City tomorrow. My new flight on Tuesday is unacceptable. Please help.
@AmericanAir This is exactly why ill be flying AA from @Dulles_Airport to Dallas! Only airline I trust!
@SouthwestAir  this is really unhelpful. Why can't I rebook online? http://t.co/N5O43sVl8i
@SouthwestAir how long do we have to be delayed after boarding before we get a free drink? #gettingthirsty
@SouthwestAir you're the best
@united Your social listening capabilities are awful if this is the reply for the context in which you were mentioned @stevelord212
@USAirways please hold 3923! I can see it. Just can't get off my first plane quick enough
@USAirways on hold for 2 hours now have been calling since Monday! I have a flight today need help now!!! #worst #NoExcusesAccepted
@AmericanAir Delayed: AA3186 - Missed due to delay: AA3186 - New flight now delayed: AA2401
@united well someone should tell that to the employees at the Denver baggage claim. Still no bag!!!!
@SouthwestAir my rating for Southwest -9 on s scale of 1 to 10
@JetBlue flight 1183 to Orlando.
@united when will you offer real food in american clubs like the amazing food you offer in Heathrow?
@united worst airline in the world-8 delays, gate agent loses her mind over 1.5 lbs and charges me $100 on top of the $25 I already paid!!
@JetBlue I love your flights! But theres always some delay unfortunately
@united make sure you take care of @LSUsoftball team &amp; @LSUQuinlanDuhon team. We are 16-0!!!!
@SouthwestAir Just wanted 2 change an anytime flight leaving at 11:50 @ 11:00. Phone hold 4 46mins. Phone answers, she says sorry - no dice.
@JetBlue what's up with the random delay on flight 1729? Any chance of it being a false alarm?
@JetBlue - loving Capt Joe on our flight from BOS to SFO #633. This should be fun!
@SouthwestAir  Glad to see you know how to keep the money in your own pockets. 'Thanks' for the voucher in return for lost bag.
@USAirways three hours on hold then disconnected. Conf EBHSET. Need to be home Sunday for interview
@AmericanAir my flight got Cancelled Flightled from GRK to DFW, then to LEX for tomorrow and I need it rebooked.
@united do you have an e-mail address I can write my account to? Might be less likely to disappear
@VirginAmerica What happened 2 ur vegan food options?! At least say on ur site so i know I won't be able 2 eat anything for next 6 hrs #fail
@united 40 minutes on tarmac now. That's after 9 hour delay.
@united yes, Thx! At 10:35 (landed at 9:20).
@USAirways now after an hour on the plane and knowing of a maint issue ahead of time they just announced another 30 mins. Y r we on plane?
@SouthwestAir beyond ready
@SouthwestAir I'm a huge fan and give y'all too much business...so please fix the damn wifi!
@united now maintenance issues with flight 5639 and more issues with passengers that will miss connections needing to get off
@united I understand, but it's tough when there is no way to get to the airport w/o serious risk of an accident. It's a steep price.
@AmericanAir Are you expecting any delays out of #DFW tomorrow morning?
@AmericanAir #customerservice. Sitting on my fourth plane today with a mechanical problem. No excuses for this. Tough to be loyal.
@USAirways  to arrive the plane I'm sitting on needs to take off...wish someone would tell us what the holdup is
@VirginAmerica all crap channels which is why I pay to watch UK tv
@SouthwestAir @Vindictive_tK Larry David works for southwest?
@USAirways I have to fly back to Charlotte out of a different airport. You guys are not very flexible like other airlines.
@united my flight is Late Flight due to mechanical issues 3 of 4 flights in past 10 days!
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/7XMaV13G2W‚Äù http://t.co/Ela7TNtcIR
@AmericanAir whenever I cheat on you it goes horribly wrong! I promise, I won't stray anymore. I'm talking about you @Delta!
@JetBlue April 6th. Anything specific I should know for my first flight?
@AmericanAir I would love to say the same but it's not so much. 5hs flight, no internet, no personal A/C, 20yr old plane. #NoFunAtAll
@JetBlue client is asking if kids need their own email addresses to get TB acct. Is this true?
@united that would have been nice earlier  today. Too Late Flight now. I hope.
@united sloppy stuff you don't see anymore - united has raised my expectations - this team was poor
@JetBlue I get Sunday due to weather and ok Monday they're busy but this is crazy
@AmericanAir Waiting an hour now for a pilot AA3688. Is there a pilot in the house at DFW?
@united yes I have &amp; they're unsure when it would come.This has never happened on any airline and my first time with @united #disappointed
@united booked a flight yesterday, appeared in my account + confirm email but since a few hours all disappeared and err "no segment in this"
@VirginAmerica your website sucks donkey dicks. Just thought you should know. All best.
@SouthwestAir can you update me on the emergency landing in Jacksonville right now? #parentsonboard
@VirginAmerica Adds Pillows Instead of Lie-Flat Seats in First Class Arms Race http://t.co/SfjDuahx9Z by @skift
@AmericanAir 2293 is the Cancelled Flightled one
@united ^JT is the ORD to PHL flight at 9:15 PM (CDT) delayed? DM I'm kinda hoping not to be stranded at ORD either.
@USAirways flight 500 out of Seattle has 10,000lbs too much fuel and no water for the lavoratories. Nice job guys - est 40min behind now
@USAirways little help to us! My husband has been on hold for an hour for something that take 5 minutes to complete.
@VirginAmerica gave a credit for my Late Flight flight yesterday. Great service !!!! That's a Wow moment! Unexpected gesture!
@VirginAmerica Hi, Virgin! I'm on hold for 40-50 minutes -- are there any earlier flights from LA to NYC tonight; earlier than 11:50pm?
@AmericanAir POOR EXPERIENCE 2day at ord chkin. 8 emp. w/3 cust. 10 waiting. Asked to speak w/supervisor. Told 20 min. In a mtg!! What?!?!
@AmericanAir AA 1657 was also over an hour Late Flight to depart Ohare and now we have no luggage. Not happy standing in a long line at baggage svc
@SouthwestAir did anyone come into work today? u should have all the pilots and flight attendants answer phones if no one is flying
@USAirways I've been on hold for 30 minutes and counting. #unacceptable
@SouthwestAir I always brag about ur service, but very disappointed today. Apparently I'll be sleeping on floor of Dallas airport tonight üëé
@AmericanAir you know nothing about customer service and I'll make sure everyone knows it
@united is the biggest joke of a company,I will never fly with them again! 3 days now waiting for my bag, they don't even know where it is!
@united flight 4567 agent now wandered off. Pilots came out looking for her. Went to charge her personal phone which she'd been txting on
@SouthwestAir Are there discounts every tuesday cause Im leaving fron Birmingham Airport to San fran Next week in march sometime
@united Instead of sending inaccurate emails about delay every 5 min, just say we will get you there when we get you there.
@AmericanAir How is hanging up on customers because of "high volume" customer service? Tried to resolve via DM-still waiting.So bad. #aafail
@SouthwestAir de-icing is important!
@united how long does it take to get a response from your customer service about a complaint done through email?
@AmericanAir two hours Late Flightr and still waiting for a callback. Need to reschedule flight 1027, hopefully to the Late Flightr one tomo not Cancelled Flighted
@SouthwestAir Any chance there's a few seats open from DEN to DAL this afternoon?
STOP THIS ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/Ac6zwmuOOn‚Äù
@USAirways This flight was for my brother. He has been rebooked and I was able to give my info over the phone to get him a pass to the Club.
@AmericanAir I will never fly with you guys again! I am stuck in memphis another day. Called to be credit something anything
@usairways hopefully your crappy service improves as u become @americanairlines #angryairtravel #winterstorm
@AmericanAir Yep, was in one of my other camera memory card :D
@JetBlue if you can get us on a flight to Vieques all will be good. Right now, not looking promising.
@AmericanAir is it right to provide faulty seats on flights plus damage a $350 bag and not replace and shrug the damage off? Flights from...
@united I wanna be grand staff
@united I would encourage you to re-interview the sole flight attendant on UAL 6166 from BUF to ORD. Blatantly not stable. Uncomfortable.
@SouthwestAir is there a link to a site that displays any delays or Cancelled Flightations of flights to and from @DallasLoveField?
@united ah, that would explain why crew didn't seem particularly distressed when we pointed it out. It was a little startling at first.
@SouthwestAir k but who won destination dragons
@united after several trials and several hours of waiting on phone to contact customer care to get my refund all I get is cold shoulder
@AmericanAir why would it take that long? My credit card company says the card hasn't been charged yet. Should it take 5 days for this?
@USAirways to my legal last name. So it's not technically a name change,I just used the wrong name
@USAirways Yes, it's February. Bad weather happens every winter. If you guys don't have the business sense to forecast that I'm at a loss.
@united Total BS.have 1st class seats for connecting flight. Your crew Late Flight. We miss connection. Had next plane. Yet u don't honor it??
@united I had planned to book additional flights tonight but after 1 1/2 hrs working on one trip I'm worn out! #EnoughIsEnough
@united flighted delayed for hours. 10pm arrival to Vegas is now 4am. Did you seriously lose my luggage???
@SouthwestAir doesn't even have gluten free peanuts. whyyy me??
@AmericanAir @RobertDwyer AA doesnt charge any fees to change award tickets as long as the origin, destination &amp; award type remains the same
@JetBlue How can I best track deals and special flight offers? I'm liking your international options...
@SouthwestAir everyone deserves red carpet tx until they destroy your luggage &amp;only give you $75 voucher, like I want to fly w/them again!
@JetBlue Thank you.
@AmericanAir You didn't call, did you. Try it, and then you'll understand.  It's not possible to reach an agent,I don't know what else to do
@USAirways is alright with me. Please give Scott F at BDL a bonus for excellent customer service
@VirginAmerica thanks!
@united I was told it was due to be on UA23 which flies direct to Dublin, so why did it go to London? This is a complete shambles!
@united while busy on his cell phone ???
@USAirways it's not like I'm trying to leave earlier just for fun. I don't want to get stuck in DC if we have bad weather in RDU.
@AmericanAir you guys should really improve the service experience with your on site personnel. This has been one of the worst experiences.
@USAirways flight was full.  1 open middle seat.  Did not want to sit there.  What is your policy?
@SouthwestAir Flight Booking Problems all my Late Flight summer travel! Did the AUS-CUN direct flight disappear?
@JetBlue Thank you, but that isn't really responding to my request, is it? You are sending me into a generic environment on your site.
@JetBlue formally requests @LBAirport and @LongBeachCity to establish customs facilities for international flights http://t.co/jByVMsOd29
@jetblue terrible landing on 915
@AmericanAir another day another grievance with this airline. No customer service
@SouthwestAir could I get a phone call from a customer service rep to get the issue resolved?
@AmericanAir AA2416 on time and awesome flight. Great job American!
@united thank you!!!!! And next flight to Durango then driving to Farmington New Mexico for work! But hitting the slopes in Durango!
@USAirways how can I make a purchase, you take the money but I don't have a reservation...Explain
@AmericanAir I've been on hold for about 3 and a half hours now. Thanks for Cancelled Flighting my flight and not notifying me.
@AmericanAir you have said the same thing to me over and over again but phrased differently. How about some actual help?
@JetBlue I can probably find some of them. Are the ticket #s on there?
@united about 3 hours ago. I need to work out if my bag can make it to my hotel here in time or if it will need to go elsewhere.
@united changed my last name for my MileagePlus acct on the site in an hour. @BA_USA had me on hold for 20mins, then 5 days &amp; no change yet
@USAirways 167 minutes?  "Im not trained in that". Cmon. Can't you do better than that?
@united seriously. This is just complete bs.
@united we are on two more flights today, let's hope the kit does not get the same treatment!! http://t.co/Pd3nbAAkxH
@united airlines 1st &amp; only time I ever fly your airline! What a disgrace. @JimTrotter_NFL I should've listened to your tweet! #HORRIBLE
@united allowing passengers on my flight to block exit of plane
@united  Your survey is too long.  I fly a lot of segments and I'll fill it out after every trip, but not if it takes more than a minute.
@united feck guys. Stop Cancelled Flightling flights from EWR to RIC the weather is fine I both locations!!!
@USAirways I did they are busy
@United "delayed due to customer service" Huh? http://t.co/XlTV5z6sT1
@SouthwestAir what robot is running this account. The same one that doesn't remember anything they ask. Same conversation over and over.
@AmericanAir wasn't able to get on hold. Your system kept kicking me to the main menu.
@USAirways u guys suck
@JetBlue Just sent it
@AmericanAir Been trying to call all day, get hung up on every time. Your guys are horrible!
@SouthwestAir NOR @SpiritAirlines fly to Toronto?!?!? You're killing me smalls.......
@AmericanAir I'm getting calls from 1-800-433-7300 but the calls seem to drop instantly. Is there any alternate avenue for resched. support?
@AmericanAir and feel free to email me mikehertz7@gmail.com - don't worry, we're not going anywhere but this damn Tarmac for a bit!
@SouthwestAir  thanks for adding passbook ability! Hopefully we can do group passbook tickets in the future somehow.
@USAirways Been on hold for 40 minutes, calling because my flight is delayed.  This type of service in not acceptable.
@united I'm not sure it will have "next time"...
@united you know what would be awesome? Providing us with complimentary entertainment on your flights. Especially those longer than 6 hours.
@USAirways if you DM me we can take this offline. Would love more info on location of lost bags. Any help is appreciated.
@JetBlue last flight was Cancelled Flightled, then it was 2 hours to change a light bulb, now sitting here waiting for maintenance. Unreal.
@JetBlue got it. thanks the quick reply.
@united BTW is it true you have to remind flight staff after checking in even after indicating meal prefer on your reservation? +
@JetBlue hope so! looks nice and warm in San Juan üå¥
@SouthwestAir Just realized I had the wrong departure date. Thanks for making changes easy!
@united installed and working are not the same. Kicked me out after an hour and wouldn't let me back in. Four wasted hours.
@united Filled out at the airport as part of a long day made longer.
@united thanks! :)
@AmericanAir your team rebooked my Cancelled Flightled AA flight on a different airline. New airline has no such Flight Booking Problems. Flight is this evening.
@jetblue rqstd upgrade to mint at LAX and was told no because i used points! Why turn down $1600 bcz I used points? #trueblue
@USAirways are you going to do anything to help stranded travelers of flight 680?! No communication from anyone. All of us dumped here.
@USAirways thank you! It's # 1875 from BWI, keep seeing different stats, from delayed to awaiting take off to delayed...
@JetBlue you guys continue to impress. Your crew @ MCO gate 4helped our family with seat issues. #professional
@USAirways #tbt every day.
@United what the...? I go into the "all airlines lounge" w/ my Star Alliance Club Card in BCN only to be told Star Alliance isn't accepted
@AmericanAir your seat assignment process when Flight Booking Problems is misleading. I'm not paying extra to select a seat.
@JetBlue Airways Corporation (NASDAQ:JBLU) Update: @JetBlue says #Lufthansa ... - Markets Bureau http://t.co/aPY3zLSqUu
@united flight attendant doesn‚Äôt understand not understanding English doesn‚Äôt mean they are deaf. Stop yelling English slowly to them.
@USAirways , I am embarrassed for us air and their inability to manage during weather delays.handling of # 4435 is an example
@AmericanAir @barrettkarabis what a joke you can mailThe receipt !! Yet. We can't mailThemA payment and fly before hand right
@USAirways have you ever lost luggage with an infant and a 4 year old? Then customer service never answered the phone. I've tried all night.
@SouthwestAir $192 rndtrp 4/30-5/5 "@DJQ_KC: RT @djimpact: If you're trying to make travel reservations for Vegas on May 2nd it's too Late Flight"
@JetBlue flight 2008
@USAirways Collectively since Friday I've been on hold with customer service for over 3 hrs. My issue is not resolved... so frustrated!
@united Classic
@united this is the second time my flights been Cancelled Flightled... Like really?
@USAirways I think it's a little weak sauce you have zero inflight entertainment for a 4 hour flight from Salt Lake to Philadelphia
@AmericanAir jal and cathay pacific so no, I can't do it online.
@JetBlue if u want to be helpful save me the trip from Westchester Cty to JFK, plus parking - my info is in the photo http://t.co/JI7xkS2jkk
@JetBlue don't know if u define that as a #ControllableIrregularity
@VirginAmerica This is such a great deal! Already thinking about my 2nd trip to @Australia &amp; I haven't even gone on my 1st trip yet! ;p
@JetBlue well our plane just landed at the international terminal... so they announced the 10 pm new time.
@USAirways #Unbelievable that for 2 consecutive days I can't get through to a person.  On hold over 2 hours and still going
@united Hi, we are flying into IAD tomorrow evening. Do you expect delays or Cancelled Flightlations with the snow storm?
@USAirways worst customer service I've ever experienced. I'll never fly your airline ever again. I have to pay to sleep in Philly. Fuck you.
@USAirways @joyadventuremom there are breastfeeding momma's watching this story all over the country! Better work on a faster response :)
@JetBlue dropped 3x in past hour
@SouthwestAir Just reading your boarding policy, we're a group of 8 travellers with kids ranging from 3-10, is it possible to sit together?
@USAirways called 3x &amp; it says high call volumes call back. At $1 a minute for international calls is there any way someone can contact me?
@united Worked like a charm. Bag was waiting on the carousel when we got to baggage claim. #welldone #goodflight #friendlysky
@JetBlue's new CEO seeks the right balance to please passengers and Wall ... - Alaska Highway News http://t.co/tynchOeLac
@JetBlue it will be glowing. Your crew and your aircraft sparkled. You guys know about @nokidhungry right? Might be a good partnership:)
@SouthwestAir done messed up now!!! I have planned a trip to #CostaRica for pennies!!! #VacaTime ‚úàÔ∏èüí∫
@united 20 yrs of flying Continental/united exclusively I get why everyone hates you - fl1289sfo/EWR #getmeoffrhisFUCKINplane
@USAirways cust serv reps who are unable to change reservations in your system Check in unaware of Cancelled Flights that I got word on night before
@JetBlue @lopezlaymari what a patronizing response to a legitimate issue
@USAirways thank you! You have always been so good to me. I will follow up.
@USAirways I'm sure you don't but question still remains why we only found out at 8.20 that crew won't come before 9.50 for 8.10 flt. Tks.
Thanks. ‚Äú@USAirways: @fispahani Weather disruptions have caused some of our crew to run Late Flight. We're sorry for the delay to your flight.‚Äù
@united 50 min on hold trying to book award flight because site errors out.  Agents ask for my pin to see platinum availability??? badbadbad
@JetBlue SHUT THE DOOR ON YOUR WAY OUT. üôÖ
@AmericanAir if i want to change my flight due to weather conditions in Dallas this weekend, i should be able to cover change fee with miles
@USAirways I am a premium #DividendMiles #cardholder. Unacceptable 4 you to #hangup my #customerservice call twice after putting me on hold.
@SouthwestAir that's why I fly y'all, that personalized service
@united yes I have
@united BUT you have received confirmation via email that you are confirmed and ticketed on this flight.
@AmericanAir I am, called Paris office this morning again, still waiting. It is in Miami but apparently tag was "taken off"
@jetblue waiting for flt 105 to Chicago. Why hasn't aircraft left buffalo yet?
@united sitting in Denver airport waiting for a plane to be refueled. For an hour and a half! Hurry the fuck up United, you fucking retards
@SouthwestAir  when is the next flight with free cocktails ?
Then you better #HoldOn - #EverythingsGonnaBeAlright @jetblue 4 our #brandloveaffair https://t.co/64kN6GEEP8 #TrueBlueLove #travel #business
@SouthwestAir YES please....How do we get that companion pass?
@united really?  Someone called in sick and then someone FORGOT to call a replacement?!  Now an hour Late Flight to take off. #theworst
@united now I'll probably miss my next connection!
@united if I wait I'll lose the flight. So frustrating.
@SouthwestAir  also, gave up after 1 hr 32 minutes on hold. Maybe put a few more people on it?
@united I should be fine. They automatically changed my connecting flight for me so I wouldn't miss it. A+ work.
@USAirways KUDOS to your phone support and Charlotte gate staff!
@JetBlue dont really know what that means but this isnt the best first-time-flying-w-a-16mo old experience. likelihood of addtl delays 2nt?
@united yes, David Allan send an email with this number (KMM24999563V99860L0KM) and case#8719519
@USAirways  you Cancelled Flighted &amp; rescheduled my flight &amp; still getting updates &amp; can't find my current flight on my account http://t.co/8Je1h3666w
.@AmericanAir nice 2 know. I paid 4 a seat. Then you sold my seat. now I bought a 3rd seat. It's a good scam, but a scam all the same.
@united now let there also pls be in-flight live TV on UA469 DEN-EWR so I can watch the #Oscars ??
@AmericanAir I'm trying to reach the advantage department to add my number to a recent flight
@JetBlue me again :) you don't have ABC on Inflight TV, do you? (If so, what channel? #SharkTank is on!)
@AmericanAir you cxl both my flights to/from DFW to CLL w/o notice then treat me like trash on the phone and offer no compensation? WTH?
@VirginAmerica no A's channel this year?
@SouthwestAir I just received your birthday card.  It was amazing and made me smile with joy.  Nice videos.  Thanks.
@USAirways - I bet you don't, but I'm the paying customer here. I know how to check for flight delays, thank you.
@SouthwestAir . I don't like the new schedule. No more nonstops from PHL to FLL or PBI? We are not free to move between those cities. Sad.
@AmericanAir @travisamex please please American call me so I can rebook ticket .
@JetBlue yes Party is Over üòÇ
@SouthwestAir we are having a real issue trying to get thru to you.  On hold for 2 hours &amp; got disconnected!  Please help!
@SouthwestAir yeah it happens. The PHX airport has extra long waits all spring long. Something locals know but tourist don't just FYI
@AmericanAir there is no local agent! There is no person to answer our questions and their phone service is terrible.
@united iah to charlotte. Baggage claim rep latrice h. #customerservice non existent, Ignored customer then inappropriately touched customer
@JetBlue Our non-profit ARC would love tickets as we rely on airlines for extractions in saving abducted children and returning them Home!
@united screwed up our reservation- they assigned a new # to just one of us &amp; when they changed our flight, only changed the original #.
@JetBlue When I arrived at the airport, I was told my ticket had been refunded because my name had a fraud alert.
@USAirways is struggling. had me on hold for 25 minutes, kicked me back to the start, then said they couldnt handle the amount of calls
@USAirways how do I get thru on hold 3 hours 5 minutes . Is this normal ? My call is lost
@JetBlue I'd fly to an airline who actually gave a crap about its fliers outside of generic apologies. Jet Blue is terrible #jetblue
@USAirways wont waive fees for flight Cancelled Flightlation due to #neptune To use credit, $200 fee. Couldnt reach destination @BostonBBB #notmyfault
@USAirways  2 hours on hold and issue still not resolved. hope to make my flight in 12 hours. for every minute of talk = 20 minutes of hold
@united Got rebooked on AA.  One question though, do you automatically refund the check baggage fees for flight that was Cancelled Flightled?
@united so is that two seats avail so far for us.
@SouthwestAir  I USED to always fly Southwest.
@united 2nd flight in two weeks that you have lost my bag!  Taking my 1K status to @AmericanAir #neveragain #WORSTCUSTOMERSERVICE
@JetBlue:  Ahoy from a loyal #AllYouCanJetPass holder! When do you anticipate direct US flights to #Havana, #Cuba? (#JetBlue #Vacation)
@USAirways in 140 characters? Yea right.   Thanks for patronizing.
@SouthwestAir why am I still in Baltimore?! @delta is doing laps around us and laughing about it. # ridiculous
@SouthwestAir can't checkin online for 2:00 flight tmrw fr. Cancun. "Undefined error" &amp; 800# not working.Family of 4 don't want Cgroup! Help
@jetblue all your online resources  say we're on time, but clearly we are not.  This is not very information age of you...
@SouthwestAir ridiculous how you want to charge me $209 to change flights even with multiple seats available on the flight I needed
@JetBlue all taken care of .... Other then the dropped call and the total half hour wait #love #jetblue
@SouthwestAir On hold for 45 minutes trying to rebook a Cancelled Flightled flight with a companion ticket. Help?
@JetBlue if I tell you I like that @warriors pick, will that get me that bump to first class? :)
@SouthwestAir was earlier, for reFlight Booking Problems flight I'm on now. Didn't get a screencap, just said "unspecified error" and to call SWA
@united So what's allowed or what's not allowed to be carried in my checked baggage?
@united you Cancelled Flight my flight. I wait in line to get rebooked, when I'm at the front you make me go to another gate and I lose my place.
@JetBlue #ClosePWCS please just tweet thisüôèüôè‚ù§Ô∏è I fly jetblue every time btwüòè
@SouthwestAir this would be an awesome experience #DestinationDragons
@united please send help ASAP to @KathrynSotelo on flight 5957 to Chicago seat 9c #Airlines http://t.co/9sKrLyrZ1O
@united can I get your service desk # at IAD?
@united 2nd time in a row  I've been over charged by 100's of $$ on my plane ticket WHY? #united I shouldn't have to check my CC everytime
@SouthwestAir Is there any chance I can get tickets for the Vegas stop? I missed my chance to enter the contest but I love ID to death !
@SouthwestAir my ticket was booked 1/27 to CUN. Does the arrival time reflect that CUN is now on EST time?
@SouthwestAir can you make a premium wifi that I can pay $30 for that is decent? #slow-fi
@united No but u cld explain how such a disorganized and inefficient company w surly and obviously unhappy employees stays in business.
@AmericanAir My flight tomorrow from SLC to DFW AA304 Cancelled Flighted. Can you help me get there?
@SouthwestAir   Are flights going into Dallas this morning?   Thanks
@SouthwestAir Can my wife's RR points be transferred to my RR account?
@united you can't claim "weather" with your hardworking crew pulling seats out of a plane! Do the right thing. But we both know you won't
@USAirways I‚Äôve had my flight Cancelled Flightled twice now, and after 5 minutes of automated questions, the phone just goes to a busy signal. Help?
@AmericanAir robocalls me with another Cancelled Flightation. And then when I don‚Äôt accept the change it won‚Äôt let me connect to an agent. Just wow.
‚Äú@USAirways: Reminder: From 2/28, we‚Äôll be tweeting from @AmericanAir.  http://t.co/mFMNKmvOTR‚ÄùRT I look 4ward to that follow back too!
@USAirways  where's my bag?  In line 200 deep at DCA. Agents say call 800 #.  800# says talk to agents. Abysmal customer service
@USAirways 1917. Thanks for the 5 hour layover in LA tooüëç Icing on the cake. At least your staff was courteous and helpful.. Not #unreal
@united has it been 4-6hrs yet?
@united so many delays today...What's up with that? Hoping my 12:26pm flight boards soon. #United #premier1K
@SouthwestAir been on hold for 1.5 hrs. What's up?
@JetBlue 1472, FLL to LGA. This is getting old. 4th @JetBlue flight in 2.5 weeks, 4th significant delay.
@USAirways all these planes sitting here and no one going home. #usairwaysfail http://t.co/jN3V3k3qGv
@united checked me in through security under the wrong name and given the wrong boarding pass. #AirlineSecurity
@USAirways and @FlyKnoxville - bad weather should not be an excuse for not following established luggage procedures. #NoClothesNoInfo
@united I am going to a service desk now to see what the options are.
@AmericanAir No. I was told I got put on another flight and that I would get an email. Still haven't gotten one yet.
‚Äú@AmericanAir: @Andrew_Wasila We're sorry you were uncomfortable, Andrew. What can we do for you?‚Äù SMA
@SouthwestAir been on hold for 20 mins to Cancelled Flight my reservation. Can you assist?
@VirginAmerica Thank you!!
@SouthwestAir a week after Valentines day..not feeling the #LUV. Going on 11 hrs @BWI and don't my bags aren't even coming w me.
@AmericanAir done. I hope you can offer something.
@united There is no "reference number." Your agent told me to "just drive to the airport" because "I can't reach anyone there to deliver..."
@united is my flight delayed? It keeps changing between delayed and not??? If delayed is checkin time Late Flightr??? http://t.co/NTUIx5dbYR
@united Yes. Did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it. Got an email that its found but not sched for delivery
@JetBlue totally would have.... but the outside view was even more camera ready haha #EvenMoreSpace #EvenMoreView http://t.co/dXuX6DBfd3
@USAirways this response doesn't correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated
@united Stopped flying @united 1 yr ago bc of aggressive policy on carryon @bdl listening to pssngrs forced to chk@preboard,#notcomingback
@united Your "Loyalty Team" basically flipped me off via phone, but thanks. Maybe Google "loyalty" and get back to me? ^LOL
@JetBlue Airways Lowered to Strong Sell at Vetr Inc. (JBLU) - Mideast Time http://t.co/yMMH9k4CBr
@USAirways already did it. One person said they couldn't do anything another said she didn't know why the first person we talked 2 said that
@JetBlue When will you release November flights for Flight Booking Problems?
@USAirways stranded @Ernie_Vigil Phoenix w/ broken foot.  Both my flights f'd, Sunday for "sickcrew".  Cancelled Flighted my mechanics flight today.
Reply to @united - Doesn't do any good to check outlets preflight when moved to different equipment after boarding due to malfunction.
@JetBlue Landed at MCO before 9am and still don't have my bag. You were supposed to give it to Disney's Magical Express this AM.I am livid!
@VirginAmerica you guys messed up my seating.. I reserved seating with my friends and you guys gave my seat away ... üò° I want free internet
@SouthwestAir Hi there. We‚Äôre flying SWA today. Our son has a peanut allergy. Any way to request the crew not serve peanuts on flight? Thx
@united Hello. Just wondering how long it might take for Turkish Airlines flights to show up in my United miles. Thanks.
@united pleasantly surprised with quality of service and flight.Flew LGA-CLE-DEN. Friendly crew. Love the concept of #byod #worksnicely
@SouthwestAir A wonderfully nice agent in Austin helped us out. Wish I remembered her name to give proper kudos.
@AmericanAir finally called! Can't get met Seattle so refund will be processed. Thanks
@united unfortunately, they didn't. I asked the staff if they could help. they said we should ask ppl in our row to switch, but no one would
@JetBlue glitches on website re: Flight Booking Problems travel &amp; checking in. Nothing between ur site &amp; the airport was communicated, it was a nightmare.
@SouthwestAir she made it standby after her flight was Cancelled Flighted for no reason. Almost 4hrs Late Flight.  Conf#¬†FVF9YW  SWRR#¬†298033455
@USAirways what's the deal with the flight computer network?
@JetBlue good to know, thanks so much!
@AmericanAir I've witnessed a manager named Denise yell at 2 different customers with my same issue. #rude
@USAirways needs to get it together in Indy. Only 2 ticket agents and a line to the door. Felt bad for ppl who missed their flights.
@USAirways hello I have a question for you and your phone lines have jammed
@USAirways Thx to gate agt John Pascucci for finding us a flight from CLT to PVD after our original one was Cancelled Flightled http://t.co/YiwLhQhZgp
@AmericanAir I look forward to hearing back and hope that my next trip will not be like this
@AmericanAir Trying to get my flight changed through dallas. Calling your number just says thanks for calling and hangs up. Guess I'm stuck
@united i have talked to them...on standby for tomorrow but it doesn't look good. May have to stay here till Friday &amp; that's not guaranteed
@united still no refund or word via DM. Please resolve this issue as your Cancelled Flightled flight was useless to my assistant's trip.
@AmericanAir it's always better to find out equipment is INOP on the ground than in the air! #safetyfirst
@USAirways I wasnt  flying your airline tonight, however a friend was and I was present for her help. I flying United and they could learn.
@united Will do! Thanks!
@AmericanAir thx for losing my bag. How hard is it to care for a bag w PRIORITY on it?why do u cont to not care for EP's?

@SouthwestAir... I love you. Air travel doesn't get easier.
@united any updates with the DOT looking at the united fares from London to the US from last week?
@USAirways Some of my 4 kids are anxious. Husband and I can't sit with all 4 with current setup. No warning that our 6 seats changed.
@AmericanAir third you lost her bag &amp; after 50 mins of being on hold you told her she would "eventually get her bag" completely unacceptable
@SouthwestAir Do you still offer discounts on seats for children under 2? We would rather put him in a seat than in a lap!
@AmericanAir Considering it was past midnight, I hung up and called again to receive another service call.
@SouthwestAir I agree! RT @9NEWS: One airline is the fly-away favorite at DIA  #9NEWSBusiness http://t.co/o3WlaInImY
@united yall should probably work on that.
@JetBlue Is there something going on with your alerts? Flight's been delayed several times for my parents and i'm not receiving any alerts.
@united stay more than 24h traveling ans sleeping on the airports floor
@USAirways They're all reservations numbers and none are in Hungary. And my phone not working here. You make it too difficult.
@VirginAmerica love it, taking @SouthwestAir on in their backyard! Consumers win when biz competes.
@united hi yes need a free hotel stay in Honalulu due to 4 hour delayUA53, since we will miss our second flight to Kauai
@VirginAmerica Are the hours of operation for the Club at SFO that are posted online current?
@AmericanAir because you won't get our bags for us because you said they would go on to Cincinnati even though we can't. Who exactly is
@USAirways @MarciaVeronicaa she missed her uncle's funeral, and you "hope" they can find another flight. That's very considerate of you.
@AmericanAir we have been advised to turn this issue over to the police due to the sexual assult THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING THAT ON YOUR PLANE!
@JetBlue what happens when I have a confirmed flight but no seat available during online checkin except for Even More Space upgrades?
@USAirways I already let them know and sent 4 complaints.  Got a call back finally when I was asleep and there is no return call back #
@USAirways how are you guys losing luggage when it was suppose to be on the same flight I was on. Highly disappointed no meds no clothes :(
@SouthwestAir great flight! And great view! http://t.co/auFM4xdaj2
@USAirways but you guys switched me and didn't inform me of the chathes
@USAirways not patient - originally 11:51 and now 4:41.
@JetBlue thanks for the help

@united agent Rick Clifton in SEA-HOU , told him my father is dying and needed to get my handbag on the cabin. he did nothing #shameful
@USAirways flight from Bhm delayed 5hrs! Connect flgt left us in clt at a motel
@AmericanAir So i was visiting SJU and was returning to Paris and they checked my bag at the gate in SJU, i arrived in paris and nothing,(1)
@AmericanAir stop sending me back to "customer relations "I have hand written a letter to them, send in a letter, called them, no help!!
@united you're right. Good you caught the mechanical failure. Too bad there are no blankets. But ok.
@SouthwestAir get me on flight 4146 to denver and I'll be more than happy !!!!!
@USAirways I appreciate the hard work. Still, I gave up after &gt;hour. @dsearls
@USAirways - had to call to find out I was re-booked tomorrow, why ask for my number an email for day of info
@united yep that's correct, I got an email at 12:30 am that the flight was Cancelled Flightled, doesn't matter now flight into atl is delayed, thx

@united flight attendant regains karma by giving big sweaty dad cold water. Guy was running &amp; carrying his daughter.  Last one onboard.
@JetBlue What's your current checked bag price policy?  I fly this coming week and couldn't find anything definitive.
@SouthwestAir Hey, friends. When I phone the A-list number your IVR hangs up on me. Multiple times. Not sure how to proceed?
.@VirginAmerica I heard he has a virgin mobile hotspot ;)
@SouthwestAir 45mins wait on the phone with no option for a callback? Finally had to hang up because my phone was dying. #customerservice
@AmericanAir I‚Äôm still waiting - this has been going on far too long. Is there someone I can speak to?
@JetBlue will you please start offering more routes out of @triflight to more locations
@AmericanAir Your response could have made all the difference. It could have made the situation better. NO TRUST...GET LOST like my bag.
@AmericanAir need2know if Ill be able to reach IND today.Rather stay in MAF that fly to DFW &amp; find out I can't travel http://t.co/gVgKHbx1RB
@USAirways what is your policy around bringing a breast pump on board?
@JetBlue Flights 1384 and 1583. I have picked up twice this week for 1583, and both times it was delayed!! üòï
.@JetBlue handled @0xjared's question like social media pros. Good practice for when our transportation systems are all run by friendly AIs!
@JetBlue just DMed. thanks so much for addressing this so quickly.
@SouthwestAir  Mad love http://t.co/4ojrSDWPkK NYC-
@JetBlue dont get me wrong i love flying with you. Tv, free bags and descent fares. The recent plane problems are just annoying.
@USAirways on hold now over 2 hrs on one phone hung on 5 x on another? How do you reach a person? No weather condition makes this excusable!
@USAirways how's us 1797 looking today?
@AmericanAir but not sufficiently sorry to actually *do* anything about it, I guess. Your systems are presumably beyond reproach or reform.
@united. You guys made my day. Treated me well. Thank you!!!
@united really hoping to get some help here.  On my 5th attempt to get a resolution, and lost count of transfers.  help please! #mileageplus
@SouthwestAir I'm excited too, but perhaps you could scale your excitement back by a few weeks...
@SouthwestAir What does this even mean?  I'm taking about letting elite customers who paid for a seat fill a seat that will go empty anyway.
@AmericanAir 1) I was on 1610 today to YYZ. I had a bit of a bag issue that was cleared up beautifully. Thank you to all of the check in
@SouthwestAir sending now via dm
@JetBlue thank you will do!! You guy are awesome!
@AmericanAir yes yes yes,so glad to be headed home!
@JetBlue You can pass that along to my wife, daughter, daughter's friend, my elderly mother-in-law.  They spent several hours waiting.
@USAirways nice try at the gate making traveler after traveler put bags in the size guide because you oversold.  Sorry #minefits
@USAirways 2 hours on hold. Still no answer. Horrible.
@united customer service what's That???
@united I did DM the details back on 02/14 when this started with phone number to reach me no reply either online or by phone
@AmericanAir thank you for quick responses.   #aa usually has fantastic customer service. That's why I was so shocked when it wasn't there
@united can u get the crew member that we are waiting on? We were told 40 minutes ago they landed here and they are still not to our gate.
.@united Not what's been shared by the pilot with passengers!
@united the long wait was the icing on the cake. Why don't you fix your reservation system so the confirm # doesn't get changed mid-travel
@united I do I was on UA 495 LAX TO DEN - we are scheduled to land LAX @ 7:38 am - please rebook to Denver - best flight
@united 2100$ ticket,12h biz trvl,no wifi.Missed con flt,next one#24h,missed meeting,7$ food voucher,hotel chkout#12,flt#5,no wifi#hotel
@AmericanAir we have posted your response on facebook for everyone to see people are appalled by your lack of concern
@SouthwestAir Can't DM you because you don't follow me.
@united airlines is the absolute worst. They have no idea what they are doing. #neveragain #UnitedAirlines
@USAirways is charging me $200 to NOT take my flight. Lol. That is the last time I fly with them.
@SouthwestAir should offer cdn border towns incentive to fly since exchange rates are #hurt. #customerappreciation #gaincustomers #keepem2
@united or I'm sure her business will go else where for airline travel. Her name is Kathryn Sotelo
@AmericanAir we've already made other arrangements ourselves.
@USAirways not given option for new flight! Why can't we get a plane PHL-MIA? 20years as an #eventprof this is worst travel experience ever
@USAirways  2 calls &amp; wasted 3 hrs on hold to change my coming divided awards weather reLate Flightd flight. Y'all disconnected me 2x. Please help.
@united well. As of yet, our checked bag has already vanished and we haven't left the airport yet.
@AmericanAir delayed for two hours at ORD--&gt;CDG the one time I need to be there to catch a train... üòí
@united still awaiting a reply from ur customer services?  18 days, no response? Lousy #unitedairlines

@united I'm aware, I fly a lot :) Just sad I had to change my shoes (boots), ha! #HappyFlight
@united no. I need you to have more than 2 agents at check in.
@SouthwestAir Every flight flown by me personally(about two round trips per month) is FULL. Still hard to believe. Fly 8 hours thru ATL?NO
@USAirways is the worst. 45 minute delay in Boston. Not weather reLate Flightd. Going to miss our connecting flight. Gassing up the plane issue.
@SouthwestAir We have been stuck in SJU for several hours and no one is answering here. Really tough to LUV SW. No response is bad.
@united I will do delayed baggage claim when I land. Hopefully the bag isn't broken into, damaged or lost w/c will result in more complaints
@VirginAmerica got it. All set - Thanks!

@united instead of making  seats smaller/thinner so u can jam more people on a flight,u should concentrate on maint &amp; happy customers
@USAirways my flight got Cancelled Flightled to Charlotte. Been on hold for an hour, pls pick up!
@SouthwestAir the last 4 times I've arrived @LASairport our gate has been blocked by a slow to depart plane leading to 30-60 min delays
@USAirways Thanks to the friendly US Airways staff that helped me get booked on various flights to get home today.  Almost there!
@USAirways 1917. Still sitting here. Feels badly handled.
@SouthwestAir you were my go to airline now not so much!! You say you care but I now see not so much! Right now, you suck!!
@JetBlue Do you have any flights with lie flat seating from STL to PDX on or around the date of March 5?
@USAirways headed to NYC from CLT. Funny to hear all phones ring at once and then the entire plane groan (has happened twice more).
@USAirways Don't want to clog your already-crowded line with a special meal request. Can someone DM me to sort out? #vegetarianproblems :)
@usairways great crew for flight 504 PHX to YVR tonight! Friendly, efficient. Awesome job.
@USAirways Reservation agent on the phone did a great job.
@united has happened on other airlines and they've given out flight vouchers and been more transparent about the problems.
@USAirways i have been tryng to rsrv a flight over the phone over the past 4 days and keep getting an automated message to call back?!?!?!
@united one hour after departure time and still no update!
@united amazing hospitality and helpfulness from Anthony Lastella. Great staff üëèüëèüëè‚úàÔ∏è def flying #united again.
@USAirways even when I do simple google search by flight number it tells me which gate so won't be that difficult am sure #disappointed
@united Done and done
@AmericanAir dm me your email address,  I will tell you my ordeal, then you tell me what you think is fair
@USAirways my in-laws flight Cancelled Flighted 4 tonight. U auto rebooked 4 flight on Tuesday that doesn't work. Can you help reFlight Booking Problems them?
@JetBlue is definitely my new favorite airline.
@VirginAmerica I called a 3-4 weeks ago about adding 3 flights from 2014 to my Elevate...they still haven't shown up...help!
@SouthwestAir it was this one but looks like the problem is now fixed. https://t.co/CFI1E3KXA9
@united Ha‚Ä¶ you rebooked me in to an 11 hr layover &amp; are robbing me of a night with my family. Too Late Flight for that. Just fly on time for once.
@SouthwestAir to start daily #B737-700 flights from #Columbus OH to #Oakland on 8AUG #avgeek
@SouthwestAir 2 hours on hold trying to reschedule Cancelled Flightled flight. Hold music stopped, but no one's answering. How can I reach a rep?
@AmericanAir I meant can you use the 50k bonus sign up mileage for Alaska flights or only American?
@united I need #United to be a better airline!!
@AmericanAir  ugh Dump us in dfw w/no luggage then Cancelled Flight our flight 3 more times. Sat arrival now Tue?
@united don't see a justifiable cost to get on an early flight with seats. No airline charges to conveniently get their passengers in early
@united yes, but it's not looking. The ticket agent at out terminal dismissed us and we missed a chance at a Miami flight then to DR
@USAirways can I book using some sort of breavement program? I need to get home for my pops funeral
@AmericanAir this merger with @USAirways @usairwis a cluster of inefficiency and misinformation.  When is it going to be done?
@united thank you for your reply.  My frustration is that spending a upgrade just puts you on a wait  list.
@USAirways sure, just DM'ed you.
@USAirways I've been on hold for 35 mins to sort out my reservation out of sync message when trying to check in, what's wrong?!?
@USAirways so what is the  difference between Cancelled Flighting and reFlight Booking Problems - will that help me avoid a change fee?
@united are you trying to break a world record for most delayed flights in a year?
@united do you guys have any working planes?
@united Rude grouchy agent at Dulles check-in just got my 19 hour trip off to a lousy start. He needs a nap or something.
@united Love to report how horrible this flight is to your team. Let's make it worse...as they get to my seat...out of all snacks
@USAirways   My email gets me a canned response that it takes 10 days for mileage to get credited --- It's been three months and my miles
@united Just did, thanks for checking! :)
@AmericanAir I ended up on a flight to LA my fourth time on standby. Thanks! http://t.co/NA5G5EAKPA
@AmericanAir RDU Customer Service is awesome. Thanks! Give em all bonuses.
@USAirways direct flights to SFO leaving from same airport with @VirginAmerica and @united - can you please put me on one of those?
@USAirways 59 minutes now. Nice customer service you got going on.
@AmericanAir thank you for the robotic and non helpful assistance.
@AmericanAir thanks for a Cancelled Flightled flight then a delayed flight and NOT telling us More missed work More $ on hotel #WorstCustomerService
@USAirways the entire flight crew on flight 738 from BOS to PHL is doing a wonderful job and making this experience not totally suck. üòä
@USAirways @PHLAirport flight 837 landed at 10:30 pm and we are still on the plane. Help!!!!!!
@SouthwestAir there... from my first interaction with your people this morning, after bad weather, sorry but I wont be flying with you again
@SouthwestAir if you are giving tix to #DestinationDragons show would appreciate one or two for LAüòÑFlying from PHL to LAX on Friday
@AmericanAir but don't you worry... @Delta took good care of me... Your loss, their gain.
@AmericanAir not helpful
@AmericanAir i got a new reservation for tomorrow. Thanks!
@SouthwestAir  Flight today from PHL to DAL Cancelled Flightled. 96 min on hold, rebooked for tomorrow. Now that flight is Cancelled Flightled.  On hold again.
@JetBlue nothing but praise for you helping our lady make her flight to CHS tonight!  #impressed
@united we will be at the airport first thing in the morning
@AmericanAir AA919 flight attendant freaks out and leaves aircraft as passengers react to a 24h delay and cattle treatment. Surreal!
@USAirways a year and every time with US Air something happens. I sat waiting for a re-scheduled flight for 10 hours then to say its
@united after a Cancelled Flighted flight, and 2 delays, you lost my luggage AGAIN! You're the WORST! Disgraceful! Awful company, horrible service!
@USAirways Thanks. No DC yet, I see. I will keep that link and check back. Appreciate it!
@AmericanAir i ordered it as i always do. But on a 9hour flight delayed for 4 hours, it was worse than ever before when you forgot my meal.
@USAirways understood and I am sympathetic. How do I get my $100 back? I shouldn't have to pay especially if YOU switched my flight.
@AmericanAir AA45 ... JFK to LAS.
@united I used to be a committed #ContinentalAirlines flyer until merger. I remember now why I switched to @SouthwestAir #CommunicationFail
@united just give up.  Your service is terrible.  If I wasn't forced to use United on certain routes, I never would.
@SouthwestAir please expedite missing bag claim #3526665682. Thanks!
@united @christinebpc ...and on some versions of the 738, row 11 has no window at all. Go ahead, check. We'll wait.
@SouthwestAir breaking my heart at BWI 9 hrs @business
@USAirways is the worst. I have to pay $200 just to NOT take my first flight in a round trip! Otherwise they'll Cancelled Flight my whole flight.
@SouthwestAir Completely understand Act of God weather-reLate Flightd Cancelled Flightlation, but 4 days without reimbursement of any kind is #unacceptable
@USAirways another squashed flight. Having to share my seat with another passenger is not@my idea of quality travel
@AmericanAir should prob give me a refund since they made me miss my flight waiting to talk to someone for 3 hours... http://t.co/4SFpcbyy9m
@USAirways we might need a plane to get somewhere but just remember that you aren't the only choice #makeovertime#customerserviceplease
@SouthwestAir can I get some luv with a fallow?
@JetBlue BOS. Everything current now. Thanks for the follow up
@USAirways is this accurate? Safety guide shown no MP3 player usage during takeoff and landing. http://t.co/Nvk3IrG4KP
@united I will. Thanks.
@VirginAmerica Hey, first time flyer next week - excited! But I'm having a hard time getting my flights added to my Elevate account. Help?
@united you have a guy named Otis at ORD that knows what #customerservice is. he was able to get my bag to me. I upgraded just to be sure
@USAirways you guys have my luggage in San Jose and were supposed to deliver it to my hotel hours ago!! Please contact me.
@JetBlue Will do.  I'll tell him you say hey.
@SouthwestAir I have 2d and 3d embossed badges and patches superior to the ones you are currently using. http://t.co/3fq3XElbOn
@USAirways I miss you too. Work has taken me out of Philly. I‚Äôve been on flight 1776 from BOS ‚Äî&gt; PHL so many times I should have a res. seat
@AmericanAir Here is the photo ;) http://t.co/VMqUURZUpW
@united surprise me.  Otherwise, the flight is over and I don't have a good feeling about your airline.
@SouthwestAir if you are going to be inconsistent enforcing your rules, I'd prefer you not randomly take it out on freq flyers that obey
@AmericanAir I was flying from Ft Lauderdale FL to Seattle WA on the 02/28/2015 until the 03/03/2015 and they don't want to honor my flight.
@SouthwestAir I WANNAA GO TO THE VEGAS SHOW SO BAD ID DOO ANYTHING #DestinationDragons
@JetBlue its a wonderful thing!
@JetBlue the amount of money I spent on hotels for a WEEK bc of flight Cancelled Flightlation, another flight doesn't make up for the money lost.
@AmericanAir really? That's it? Not even a "we are looking into this to see what happened/what we could do better next time"
@united of course not. The inflight crew was great!
@united Maybe be hiring your own ground staff at LAX when multiple gate agents tell you your baggage is loaded you expect it to be. HOPELESS
@united 6 minutes to boarding at b12 in Ord. No sign of gate agent. A little help?
@united Another terrible experience with United. Discrimination. Delays. And no help from customer service #united #notimpressed
@SouthwestAir snow forecasted for Raleigh NC tomorrow night. Need to know if there's a plan to reschedule flights into RDU Wednesday night
@AmericanAir thx for nothing on getting us out of the country and back to US. Broken plane? Come on. Get another one.
@AmericanAir I cannot believe how long flight 759 PHI  is taking. I know it's US Airways but you own it. I would really like to get home.
@JetBlue we now have to get off of the plane and wait another 1-2 hours for someone at the @BuffaloAirport to read the temp. #tired
@united what is that going to do for you? Nothing just like you always do
@SouthwestAir woohoo that just made my day. I looked and just couldn't find that, thank you!
@VirginAmerica why must a traveler miss a flight to Late Flight check a bag?  I missed my morning appointments and you lost my business. #sfo2lax
@AmericanAir ...why would you sell seats for a 7 hour flight with half of the legroom occupied by an escape raft? http://t.co/DTHEyOFXrB
@united not tonight, we got a hotel and after 14hrs of traveling and still not reaching our destination we are disappointed. Thanks
@USAirways - almost 2 hrs 30 mins on hold - any idea how much longer?
@SouthwestAir at troubadour with @Imaginedragons .#DestinationDragons http://t.co/rKlQXXaWhc

@JetBlue - trying to fly from BOS to JFK. Flight delayed. Traveling with kids. Book a hotel or are we getting out tonight?
@united Delayed CMH to ORD. Ran to gate 1 min b4 connection -door closed no one around. Ignored by 1st agent, 2nd super rude. #thanksunited
@AmericanAir Weather was not involved.
@SouthwestAir That's an awesome library.
@JetBlue my mom always said to never settle. If your chips ain't blue, you just won't do.
@united Cancelled Flightled a flight cause the crew needed sleep.But it's totally okay to wake me up at 3am just to let me know it's Cancelled Flightled, again.
@AmericanAir first flight is Cancelled Flightled. Been on hold for 4 hours. Need information and getting none. Help?
@SouthwestAir I need updates on my flights 464 &amp; 3574. I have been on hold for over 2 hours.
@SouthwestAir Do you promise to not unfollow me? üòâ
@united Do you mean "fortunately"? I don't want my flight to be affected! üòâ
@SouthwestAir why was flight 4199 out of Boston tmrw @ 1230 Cancelled Flightled?
@united I was rebooked, however it would have been nice not to have to wait an extra 90 min at the airport.  How will you make this right?
@USAirways #428 delayed due to #frozentoilet #medicalissue #mechanicalissue #dispatchissue We've heard it all! #LetsGo

@USAirways : its just a very bad customer service experience// can you help
@SouthwestAir been on hold to rebook a flight to CMH for 1.5 hrs. Your rebook website is crashed.
@SouthwestAir how is tkt in the A grp for a cxld flight gets stuck at the back of the Cs when your site, phone and agents took 1h to rebook
@united that's exactly the point. It fits. I'm premier access. Boarding group 2. This was a return ticket. I've been doing this for 15 yrs
@JetBlue it seems almost inconceivable that sitting a 5 year old alone is considered okay. But this guy thinks so. http://t.co/q9n6NZYSpK
@USAirways HELLO!! Is anyone behind your twitter account? #badcustomerservice
@USAirways getting extremely frustrated w/ the phone/online service for merging frequent flyer miles.
@AmericanAir nothing to do with Mother Nature, more like poor commutation.
@SouthwestAir hv wounded vet stuck in Chi. He's traveling to NY 4 healing. Need fly ny Late Flightst AM by 9 2 catch intl flt. Help!
@SouthwestAir is there a way to know who checked my bag on the curb? She was awesome!!! And want to be sure she gets a high five!

@JetBlue real shit my nigga north don't play around!
@AmericanAir Thanks!
@united Yes. Doesn't make that mistake any less absurd. Doesn't change the fact that I'm very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight.
@AmericanAir LGA 2 Nashville Cancelled Flightled phone center no help. Fabulous staff at gate D4 helped-2 young men handled crowd well.
@USAirways The automated message isn't helpful and it's impossible to speak with a human right now. Desperately need our luggage :(

@SouthwestAir  flight at 630 from fll kiosk just opened. Rude attendants because now everyone is Late Flight. http://t.co/2Boh2Mh3cb
@united +what took me aback was the response by the flight attendant, who put the responsibility squarely back on passenger's shoulders. +
@USAirways  in don't have it on me at the time as I am taking Amtrak home. How do we call for partial refunds?
@united @annricord January 15th.
@AmericanAir Can you respond to my DM?
@SouthwestAir wanting a ‚≠êÔ∏è for the ‚úàÔ∏è finding the gate. No apology or exp. All good, I'm sure connecting flight leaving SAC will be chill!
@JetBlue  please start flying to Guyana soon
@VirginAmerica wow this just blew my mind
@united hey, it's 4am, guess what I'm doing? Not sleeping! Why? Cause you care so little about your customers you let them sleep in airports
@JetBlue Does @AirCanada not take fraud as seriously?
@JetBlue big shoutout to the crews on 2017 Bos&gt;jfk &amp; 486 jfk&gt;roc, &amp; gate crews at c19 Bos &amp; 6 jfk. Long day of delays made better by them!
@JetBlue not cool to announce a flight "delay" when everyone is checking in. A 4 hour delay bdl-dca with a staff offering  no help.
@AmericanAir re-staff and commence new policies because your industry is so embarrassed by you.
@SouthwestAir unveils 4 new routes, including  2 from #Ohio http://t.co/4uRzvBPJKO via @usatoday
@JetBlue thanks to O StBernard for taking time to read through page to find info as supervisor felt to insist tho I showed previous comm
@SouthwestAir = easy and pleasant. @united = difficult and stressful. Learned my lesson.
@USAirways oh I got right through to an agent. They just kept putting me on hold and still didn't fix the problem
.@united you should really have that addressed somewhere on the website, find that completely irritating &amp; am unable to take my flight now.
@SouthwestAir hi, can you please tell me why today's flights from Chicago to DIA were Cancelled Flightled? Thanks!
@united &amp; I've been hung up on twice by your staff. So upset right now
@united I will not be flying you again
@JetBlue seriously?? What is going on?! http://t.co/mTHM9waObu
@JetBlue @WSJ #JETBLUE treated me right as a #disabledtraveler thanks for a no hassle flight to @jamaica
@united its available online I just can't figure out how to do it to guarantee same flight
@JetBlue you delay all my flights. Then you redirect my gate. Then you tell me had we stuck with the original gate we would have 1/3
@VirginAmerica I just did, how can I DM? Do u have to also add me?
@united also checked email you have on file for me and it is correct
@USAirways - Janet &amp; my DEN-PHL  flight Cancelled Flightled Saturday, USAIR rescheduled automatically &amp; notified us by email at no additional cost.
@USAirways Can you help me update KTN on the profile?  Ticket book via AA &amp; that info didn't get pass on.  I've been on hold forever
@JetBlue thanks
@united it is cool. Your customer told me they didn't care either. It is expected
@united I know this is probably a no but is there a way to get a cheaper airfare ticket if the flight is leaving in a few hours? üôè
.@united This flight attendant was extremely helpful to a woman who had a hard time walking. Very touching!
@AmericanAir "bag has not yet been located". Again, 5th time I've checked it. How can tracking my bag be this hard for your system?
@USAirways thanks.
@USAirways as far as being delayed goes‚Ä¶ Looks like tailwinds are going to make up for it. Good news!
@AmericanAir @USAirways She's on Manch to Charlotte Fl 4628 Told her she could get on a 4pm flight to West Palm Beach. Nothing earlier?
@USAirways how is it that my flt to EWR was Cancelled Flightled yet flts to NYC from USAirways are still flying?
@united Baggage check in and in flight crew the friendliest ever Flight#417 ogg to Lax !!!
@AmericanAir I've called that and they said they can't help me and it's out of their hands. I really feel like an under appreciated customer
@JetBlue even tho the extra 5 lbs are still going on the plane, just as a carry on. Where is the sense? What do you say to fat people?
@united screwing me over twice in one month. Learned my lesson. We are through.
@united ok so what is being done about my experience? My family had a terrible experience for $1,200. It's kind of like being robbed.Explain
@USAirways now telling me I don't have the correct tag for my luggage!!! My luggage apparently is not in LA or Charlotte. This is not ok!!
@USAirways flight to Des Moines Cancelled Flightled. Unacceptable to be booked on flight on Tuesday because of work commitments. 2hrs on hold
@usairways RT @Dmoukdarath: Nice, another delay with @usair second one this trip. Left engine leaking...what's next?? #USAIR #nothappy
@united why not? Is it a law or a policy?
@VirginAmerica Just trying to book tickets to NYC and facing super fun broken styling. Don't worry, I'll keep trying :)
@AmericanAir on plane for JFK-&gt;SFO, been sitting here for 1.5 hours waiting for push crew, how is this acceptable?
Despite Mother Nature's best efforts, @SouthwestAir's good-humored folks got us home safely in an area heavily affected by winter storms.
@SouthwestAir but when do I get my gin &amp; tonic !?!?
@united you'll be hearing from me for sure.
@SouthwestAir flight yesterday Cancelled Flighted. Got to airport 4am today for an on time flight w was delayed Cancelled Flighted than reinstated which caused
@USAirways so disappointed. Least you could do is give us access to admirals club for an hour before our flight to our wedding!
@USAirways with such disrespect I cannot even begin to explain. He has an issue with women and he literally yelled at me and pulled me off
@SouthwestAir Could you maybe hook (@FuyukaiDesuYo ) with some imagine dragon tickets tonight! SHES a HUGEEEEE FAN &amp; would really love to go
@SouthwestAir just did last night. Thanks for following up. :)
@united online inchecking able in the Netherlands (ams)?
@united I6EP18
@united it wasn't a delay so much as a straight Cancelled Flightlation. Weather wasn't an issue either.
@SouthwestAir I wish I would've known so I could've slept 2 hours more and let my friend know not to wait for me after she lands...
@united I'm afraid not... I fly or service every week and I'm just unhappy..spend too much money to be unhappy
@USAirways International
@VirginAmerica Use another browser! 2015 &amp; a brand with a reputation built on tech response doesn't have a cross-browser compatible website?
@united is really getting horrible. So much for tucking in my kids tonight. Delta transfers miles/status, right? http://t.co/H6HN33JJJE
@USAirways @AmericanAir Is there a way to reserve a veg meal online for a flight to Brazil tomorrow? I've been onhold for more than 1 hour.
@united Hi there bag ID is UA6016053916 can you update me and explain why is occurred when I arrived 4 hours before flight!
@AmericanAir i ordered it as i always do. But on a 9hour flight delayed for 4 hours, it was worse than ever before when you forgot my meal.
@SouthwestAir where is mines?
@united you guys suck, 2 1/2 delay to get out of ers and didn't even have curtesy to let me know,  #UnitedAirlines
@united why do you guys split up the charges to credit cards? Making it unnecessarily more expensive for people to fly with you guys on pts
@JetBlue you just tight that you're #59 on the world's best airlines list &amp; @VirginAtlantic is ranked higher! @VirginAtlantic here I come!
@SouthwestAir thanks for the follow up.  I appreciate it.
@united: No friendly skies from you today. 5hr+ weather delay in SFO followed by 1hr+ mechanical delay while sitting on plane. #NoFun
@USAirways yes .not sure how you guys don't know gate is occupied and keep us waiting
@united we were told when we checked in, as soon as we were allowed to, that there are no other seats available on the plane except middle.
@USAirways always letting me down. üëä
.@united I took a screenshot and emailed it to myself. Let's DM and figure this out.

@united disappointed to learn you are now charging $200 to use 20k miles for upgrades on PS JFK flights. Will be looking at alternatives.
@united I've filed the claim but have no way of calling for updates. Is there another way to do this?
@JetBlue glad you like it. Feel free to steal it.
@JetBlue This is the error message: Paper tickets cannot be serviced on-line.Please see a JetBlue Crewmember for assistance.
@SouthwestAir not to mention I now have to sit in the airport for 4 hours. You've ruined my trip. I am not happy and want compensation.
@USAirways can't even get on hold to wait to speak to someone-awesome
@united Change made in just over 3 hours. For something that should have taken seconds online, I am not thrilled. Loved the agent, though.
@USAirways been on hold for 2 hours for something which I could have done in less than 1 minute if it was available.Your site UX is awe full
@AmericanAir I have emailed several times.hand wrote a letter,went to airport,called.please fix this! Or @abc7newsBayArea please help!
@USAirways what is wrong with you guys and your inability to get planes in and out of Philly on time. Our pilot gave us a answer that was bs
@united will flight 5559 to YYC be providing free food when we are allowed back on board  after the "broken lightbulb"
@USAirways why is it impossible to change / buy preferred seats via your app?
Too little, too Late Flight. You suck RT @USAirways: @mitchsunderland Oh no, Mitchell. Our agents are happy to offer you available options.
@USAirways "Owen F" at DCA Gate 42: #rude.
@AmericanAir - for the past 5.5 hours, call volume is so high that no one can take my call to Cancelled Flight my itinerary? #YoureDoingItWrong 1/2
@AmericanAir will not help us on the phone, at the gate or in checkin. I book travel for clients and cannot believe the lack of service
@united Kurt and the crew on UA1745 were amazing today. They made my son's birthday with their kindness. Hope to fly with them again soon!
@USAirways sorry, I meant flight 4420, which was supposed to depart at 5:00, now says 6:30. What is the issue?
@JetBlue love traveling with Jetblue. Cant wait to go to Paris oui oui!!! NYC was awesomeee!
@united can you change DKYDE6 to 4583&gt;36 on 2/23 instead of 3636&gt;606&gt;36; original reservation was for 4404&gt;36 yesterday but was Cancelled Flightled.
@AmericanAir Not good enough. No info communicated at any point - just silence. for hours as we sat. Oh, and then seat was broken. #worst
@southwestair please help us check in... i never expected you to make travel painful... just like the rest all of a sudden...#intlcheckin#
@united there's no reason it should take 7-10 days to respond.
@SouthwestAir give me tickets to the atlanta show and I'll roadtrip from Canada!! Deal? üòÜ
@united lost bag in Huston we leave for a Bahamas cruise today from #nola and had to buy all new stuff. Customer service is non existent
@united no because you will charge me or delay me further. United 1612 still waiting.
@USAirways can I speak to a human with some compassion? I wrote an email to discuss my experience and received a generic "sorry" email back
@USAirways at which point in told they have sold my voucher because I wasn't fast enough
@USAirways see you on board tomorrow
@JetBlue hard when you're with your younger siblings and cousin and they just want to go on the airplane. We should get better than this
@united you always surprise me with the awfulness of your airline. You guys suck. #worst
@united Yeah that didn't happen!
@united, if you mean beyond opaque "maintenance issues", yes, that would be  basic in customer service which your EWR staff can't manage.
@AmericanAir I had to pay extra $$ cos that flight was "no longer available" just because it wouldn't accept my US Card for a 1 way into NYC
@united 3866 is at a stand still! No pilot or paperwork for fix over 25mins! Problem was fixed 30mins ago. Flight is as is delayed!
@USAirways waited for 3 hours NO LUGGAGE line too long left airport when flight Cancelled Flighted WHERE does luggage GO? On hold for 1 hour so far
@united Will definitely do so. Sending a DM now.
@USAirways how do I reserve my seat on the AA flight I transfer to from ORD to EVV?
@SouthwestAir Thanks so much!
@SouthwestAir if you're going to charge for wifi, do us all a solid and make sure it doesn't take the length of the flight to open a page
@JetBlue Using JetBlue miles?
@AmericanAir for my delay and you know what I get a we don't credit anybody back a supervisor who cut me off when speaking
@SouthwestAir stop ur bs promos of ‚úàÔ∏èanywhere starting at 79$ I click and everywhere I'd fly=130$ The only place thats 79$ is CLE #NoThanks
@JetBlue is the best!  Can't wait to use my travel bank $ for a FUN trip.
@united next day
@united - why am I sitting on this plane for an hour after scheduled takeoff without a cloud in the sky? #keepusguessing #isthisyourfirsttry
@SouthwestAir I, along with other passengers repeatedly asked Southwest personnel what was taking so long, where was our luggage.
@united - could you please send me a phone # to the refunds department?  We have submitted our claim through email without success.
@united Was on NH10 on United ticket, rerouted to IAD due to weather in JFK. Can you get us home on United 5713 or 3277?
@SouthwestAir @ PIT- Gate A1! Big shout out to the lady trying to track him down!
@SouthwestAir, rude customer svc, won't accommodate an earlier flight w/o $400 charge. US Mail takes priority over customers. #badservice
@United - In case you're reading this, UA230, right now, 7D. So many oversized carryons taking up too much room. Enforce your rules.
@united each flight is worse than last! flight attendants don't even know whether the plane is equipped with power outlets at the seats!
@united Why was flight 1180 EWR to MCO Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow and what do I do to rebook. Asking for a relative.
@AmericanAir Your gate attendants in ABQ are awful as was your service. You should be ashamed. Terrible experience here from start to finish
@united well the income flight to dca to take us to ewr was delayed and it made us miss our connection to FLL so yes hotels were necessary
@USAirways sure knows how to pamper customers they strand abroad. #badcustomerservice #fend4yourself #youareonyourown http://t.co/Pw1eudlcZg
@USAirways - you kind of screwed my day up, at least it was outbound, but you did save it by stranding me in a @RenHotels @MarriottRewards
@usairways Cancelled Flighted and rescheduled. said I'd have to pay $75 for earlier flight at next gate. Today @delta proactively offered same for $0
@SouthwestAir Whoa. Thanks and that's what I wanted to hear! Early flight coming up. Thanks for the reply.
@AmericanAir sorry so Late Flight, responded to your DM.
@DeltaAssist what I have to say is more than 140 characters! Plus you don't follow me
@USAirways still not in the air for deicing of plane. I'll miss connect but customer service was helpful.I'm hoping to catch the next flight
@USAirways Almost 4 hours and coin now. Understand higher call volume, but this is unacceptable.
@USAirways you are horrendous.  Pull your shit together
@USAirways thank you! I will be calling you! #CheapOairChat
@USAirways the only way to assist, is to actually answer the phone.
@united we booked at the same time AND he called was told confirmed we were linked. Even after he had to make changes to his rez.
@united Just submitted my response on the link you sent.
@USAirways I've been on hold for over 90 minutes... There's a lack of quality service here.  Nobody cares that I hate your shitty airline.
@united no announcement re extra baggage, "find an empty bin" down to aisle 20 back up with baggage to my seat row 7. YOUR agents argueing
@JetBlue the first place but I really didn't need the extra stress at this already terrible time. Oh by the way, I made the flight with 30
@USAirways You suck in Philadelphia.  Let us off this plane! #phl
@AmericanAir I will and I will share with many, many others. #filmcrew #media @WSJ @nytimes @latimes @chicagotribune
‚Äú@JetBlue: @FinleyBklynCFS So glad to hear. Thanks for sharing the video.‚Äù Me and JetBlue are #BFF üôè
@JetBlue still waiting to board and see if they will give us the exit row.
@JetBlue someone is here but has no info smh one bag came off  and then nothing
@AmericanAir now a delay to the rebooked flight?!
@USAirways Also, we are in family crisis &amp; you charge full price for all these flights, PLUS $200 2 change flights, even for emergencies.
@USAirways first, luggage got stuck in a different city, now I get them back today &amp; one of your employees stole a pair of gloves from me!
@SouthwestAir I'm following now
@JetBlue we don't need anybody else!
@JetBlue how come you're responding to everyone else and not me #wtf
@united took this one just for you. Not a window. Also not fun if you get motion sick. http://t.co/m81rV0blxs
@united no Cancelled Flightn just left us to fend for ourselves when flt came in Late Flight. Getting runaround for 3 hrs. Each employee blaming  previous 1.
@AmericanAir good care of their customers if anything happen to then take you @Delta  for getting me back to NYC !! Screw you @AmericanAir
@united I understand the intention, but it pales in comparison to a day of lost wages for both my wife and I because of the delay.
@USAirways Saying my friend missed her flight when she clearly sat next to me on the plane &amp; now you're Cancelled Flighting her flight home.. WTF!?
@united already done that. the answer i got was... oops we can give you miles and we're very sorry. but who pays for my discomfort for 9 h?
@united an efficient layout at kiosks/bag drop lines would help as there is no definition to space. Additional friendly and helpful staff
@SouthwestAir Awesome. Thanks! You guys rock!
@AmericanAir I was told I had a 20minute wait time after waiting hours. And an hour has gone by. This is ridiculous
@united Terminal 1 gate B3. Flt 1299. Then take her to Terminal 5. Gate M13. Swiss Air LX009
@SouthwestAir I love my Companion Pass (qualified 4th year).  #HollyMais
@united diverted and missed our connecting flight. Was just told that my bag is on it's way to MSY. If you only had people that cared
@united Thank you. Mention that before I boarded she asked 1other person to measure their bag, and it was another woman. Men not asked.
@united MR, she's on her way now, but thought id detail the extravaganza for you... #dobetter #please http://t.co/V8PVpHMtZc
@VirginAmerica - the passenger in 7D, Flt 338 that assaulted me shouldn't have flown. I trust he's banned. Crew filed report to @FAANews
@SouthwestAir constantly providing wonderful views and service! #SouthwestLuv http://t.co/9UNxqOTzIK
@USAirways 1 hour and counting on hold :( why? http://t.co/clOB5qwMXR
@VirginAmerica ok! first time flying with you tonight :)
@AmericanAir when should i expect a response from customer relations
@united Hi, flight 1051. If I try and book a new one way,  flight departure shows up as 3:55pm which seems accurate.
@USAirways message me if you want to issue a refund so someone else can use my seats tomorrow AM #flightCancelled Flighted #custservicehasnonumber
@united yes, after this awful weather it appears I can get home
@SouthwestAir so happy that you can finally put your #southwestairlines boarding pass into passbook! Makes life so much easier ‚úàÔ∏è
@SouthwestAir k thanks :)
@united Thanks for taking care of that MR!! Happy customer.
@united do you know how to use twitter bro?  Your terminal looks like it's in Bosnia.  Here's another pic. http://t.co/M9Nywr5Kbs
@united I missed it. Set up in a hotel. Flights delayed in SFO for 6+ hours. Missing all the wedding festivities of my friend. üòû
@JetBlue I understand delays.  We are all looking at a tv monitor at ur gate and it says current conditions are snow, hence delay.
@JetBlue You failed. That's the answer. Please don't justify otherwise.
@united Thanks...seat made for a 6 year old and a broken TV. 20 flights/year...my last on your airline.
@USAirways issues are not with people who r nice or storm emails with wrong phone numbers auto rebooked flights to non connecting cities
@USAirways wonder if this misery is considered a damage in a breach of contract lawsuit #lawyerup
@SouthwestAir How about auto check in for CP holders? Come on.
@americanair I sure do. I'm running version 3.10.0
@united Greetings. UA Club member here. Any idea if I can use the Air Canada Lounge at YVR. Flying UA tomorrow.
@AmericanAir Flight attendant #YeseniaHernandez provided excellent service among peculiar conditions throughout the day ‚úà :-)
@JetBlue nope. None to be found
@united I was only trying to get my emails. What are you talking about? What most business people expect from airline wifi
@USAirways so far no call back
@AmericanAir Hi, did the discount award policy for credit card holders change? No longer seeing the chart of specials on the site. Thanks!
@united Thanks; might want to fix this line: "Our Customer Care team is currently responding to most inquiries within 7-10 business days."
@USAirways the plane i am on is having mechanical issues. Why cant i get off and get on a new flight? Now i have missed my connecting flight
@AmericanAir thanks so much!
@SouthwestAir sitting in Newark because flight 4179 was Cancelled Flightled for no apparent reason.  All I was told was sorry after 2.5 hrs waiting
@USAirways still just sitting here. nobody has said anything. What's up?
@AmericanAir thx, just sent the DM
@VirginAmerica love the 90s music blasting at gate in #Boston while waiting for flight to #SanFrancisco. Only if I could get an iced coffee!
@united Marcus helped me - good agent, couldn't fix it. Flight was listed on website, but "unavailable"to book. False advertising much?
@SouthwestAir I DMed you :)
@united will the kudos to capt. Herman be relayed to his chief pilot or should I be emailing someone?
@USAirways i want an Icecream baby...
@JetBlue ok we got as far as Atlantic City due to JFK being closed. Can you get us to HPN or LGA?? Please?
@united What delivery service do you use? I'd like to call them myself.
@USAirways and despite the fact I see you answering all these people on twitter with mundane qs you refuse to answer me!
@JetBlue #611 from JFK to LAS still delayed?
@SouthwestAir has the WORST customer service of any airline I've ever flown.
@AmericanAir this is unbelievable and unacceptable. Flight #293. JFK. Everyone at the gate is upset as most of us have been here all day.
@SouthwestAir flight to Atlanta getting Cancelled Flightled and then had to re schedule on the phone for over 1.5 hours with a rep this bumping us
@SouthwestAir Hello SWA, Who is your POC for partnerships with nonprofit organizations in BWI area?
@AmericanAir AA agent said I repeated myself when I was explaining. I told him "I understand English." His reply?"Our conversation is over."
@USAirways @AmericanAir I was meant to fly on Sat, you just made it Tues, I can't afford to stay in a hotel for another TWO nights!
@united so much for being here to help. Very disappointed in your customer service.
@JetBlue I flew to San Francisco from Fort Lauderdale with you last year, had a fantastic time so would like to go back !
@united someone needs to DM me and resolve this correctly. Extremely disappointed with the service I received. Terrible management.
@USAirways have you heard about the debacle at DCA? What is happening with our New Orleans flight? #wewanttoknow
@AmericanAir Sorry, what equipment? Have the passengers been allowed to return to the plane?
Thanks @united for writing back. To assist you can return the bag you lost &amp; clean up the feces sprinkled in your bathroom. Too much to ask?
@united switched to fly united from delta for the past two trips and was very disappointed. Now my UA4646 on 2/23 is delayed by 3 hours!!
@united compensate us for new clothes bet you won't
@united no worries Your customer service gets a bad wrap but just spoke w agent who saved me huge amounts of time &amp; apologized for yesterday
@USAirways @AshleyKAtherton Over an hour on hold so far
@AmericanAir I love the Admiral Clubs! Thanks, hey can you follow me?
@JetBlue - Yes. Best case scenario I get my gear Late Flight Friday, early Saturday. Camp starts at 6AM tomorrow #toolittletooLate Flight
@USAirways I certainly understand the hold delays for WX reschedules - I've been on for 2hr15min - do you have an estimated wait time?
@JetBlue Thanks for the instant reply, and for still doing first bag free (so important)!
@AmericanAir sitting on plane in Columbus, supposed to leave an hour ago. Now the mechanic can't find a tool to service the shock absorber.
@united Definitely a compliment! I really thought my bag was lost after it was sent on to another airport. In the end I am a happy customer
@united My post was just more of disappointment.  I'm a frequent United flyer, it was a simple ??.  1 bad apple doesn't spoil the bunch.
@SouthwestAir I have the DM from @SouthwestVerity if needed
@united education of that staff is needed - he also turned away other first class cabin passengers with mileage plus.
@united quick (serious) question - any resources/ratings showing the quality of service is better than 8th place? http://t.co/deWIthPeW2
@AmericanAir This is getting a bit ridiculous when and you have made me miss 2 full days off work and had to pay for cabs back and forth
@united I see several economy plus can you put us in those. We don't have to be seated together
@JetBlue ...second incident of lost baggage.  I sent you a DM.  Thoughts?
@SouthwestAir we're here at MCO. Thanks.
@JetBlue thank you! Hopefully it's soon! We are supposed to leave at 11:23
@united you have the nicest gate attendant at Newark airport gate 101 right now. Multiple delays and she is still pleasant with everyone.
@AmericanAir Kudos to the captain and crew for handling fustrated people while dealing with the preventable issues and shortcomings by maint
@VirginAmerica, I submitted a status match request a while back and still haven‚Äôt heard! I‚Äôm flying on Monday. Can you look / accelerate?
@SouthwestAir That would be great. Thank you! I'll send it over when you follow.
@AmericanAir thank you
@VirginAmerica has getaway deals through May, from $59 one-way. Lots of cool cities http://t.co/B2Xi4YG5T8 #CheapFlights #FareCompare
@JetBlue Ok great thanks! I had a great flight, FYI. I'm excited to fly again. I just was frustrated I was not able to check in.
@JetBlue Has D.C. Thinking About Summer With New Nantucket Service - Digital Journal http://t.co/urcyfcp2Lx
@JetBlue I just submitted feedback for you @gripeo. Not a good way 2 handle baggage or customers: http://t.co/F6COpX1Fvj
@USAirways u guys get too much $$$ and too many customers  to be fucking up as badly as u do
@USAirways started trying to reach a real person over an hour ago still no luck
@USAirways I do but the real ? Is why your staff can behave offensively. Flight 699. Please look into it. Message me if you want particulars
@SouthwestAir CEO Gary Kelly, "We are America's most loved and most flown airline!" #SouthwestRally #BWI #bestemployees #swaculture #swapic
@jetblue you just directed me to your mobile website. Where is the direct link? GET IT TOGETHER!
@AmericanAir I have never on all my trips on any airline ever nat'l or int'l ever experienced anything like this!
@USAirways been on hold for over and hour now.
@SouthwestAir Any idea when the winter advisory will be posted for ATL for tomorrow (2/25)?? I'd rather get to PHL tonight.
@united Hi.  My relative's Flight Booking Problems number is MY8YB4.  Her name is Clarita Jaramillo Mejia.  Thank you
@USAirways have been on hold for 58 minutes - need help USAIR - why won't you help?
@AmericanAir we're all being told by emergency services to stay home for the next 24-48 hours.
@AmericanAir oh it's nothing my issue was already resolved and I am in the air
@AmericanAir I don't think you should help him at all based on his behavior. The voucher and cot seem like enough lol üòÉ
@usairways #usairways #unacceptable #holdtime REALLY?! http://t.co/UPp41AbxrQ
YO! @InternJohnRadio @mrerickv  give @SouthwestAir their plane back.  They're mad &amp; threatening to take away my Companion Pass. #Luv
@SouthwestAir, I really appreciate you all's #BHM commercial that aired today during @BET's #BookofNegroes
@SouthwestAir how can I check to see if my flight to NYC is expected to be delayed or Cancelled Flightled for this Tuesday?
@united please get me off this plane #UA57
@USAirways I did at 7 pm! Still no bag..
@JetBlue thank you for incredible customer svc from gate to flight. Mint experience is magic.
@JetBlue OH YEAH!!! great flight down to Mexico with a wonderful crew!! Thank you!!
@AmericanAir Flight 3487 delayed 1 hour because of pilots? I spend 5+ hours on the phone just to get an EP agent on the phone now this?
@SouthwestAir Jason (108639) at Gate #3 in SAN made my afternoon!!! #southwestairlines #stellarservice #thanks!
@united I got email update but still no ETA. More communication/details, apology + info on compensation rights would go a long way
@SouthwestAir We did not get a single answer from any Southwest personnel. After an hour's wait. No apologies, no explanation.
@united #UnitedAirlines Any other way ORD to ABQ anytime within the next 7 hours?
@united also why can't I pre-select seats on SFO-&gt;YYZ flight? I'm a Canadian Flight Booking Problems on http://t.co/aZltJhf7lv.
@USAirways Thanks. Suggestion: stop the promo messages after a bit and just run music &amp; a msg that says "call volume is high." #vrm
@united who compensates is for the delays caused by the fact that you don't have enough flight attendants?? http://t.co/96apr35qan
@USAirways you used to have an evening flight DCA-DSM and an early AM return. Now it's middle of the work day for both. Inconvenient.
@united 4 open seats in 1st class on UA 2065. Way to honor your upgrade policy for freq flyers and/or honor an employee with an upgrade.
@united I need assistance with pulling your agents' heads out of their asses
@JetBlue At what time?  All these passengers were sitting on a hot plane with no air and no communication for over 2 hours. Just wrong
@AmericanAir .. UMM hello?
@VirginAmerica I have an unused ticket but moved to a new city where you don't fly. How can I fly with you before it expires? #travelhelp
@SouthwestAir After multiple attempts, I was finally able to submit them Late Flight last night.
@AmericanAir When did they start to sell water @AdmiralsClub ?
@VirginAmerica omg omgüòçüòç nonstop Dallas to Austin on virgin‚ú®üò±‚úàÔ∏è
@AmericanAir. You neglected to mention the $200 fee per ticket.  I had a medical reason and still have had to jump thru hoops.
@JetBlue Why close prechk at 8PM on a Sunday at JFK?  #annoying
@AmericanAir Its the ABC's of PR, let your customers have the most info possible. Might want to go brush up on the basics...
@united I was on UA3782 and it was Cancelled Flightled. I'm waiting at customer service.
@SouthwestAir now I don't get the common courtesy of my phone call answered. Either policy is bad or people should be fired. #dissaponted
@United Hidden City forces me into crappy seat even though exit row is available on the first leg. Your support cannot fix. :-(
@JetBlue Why would you charge money to transfer points to someone?
@USAirways hey folks where do you hide luggage when you Cancelled Flight a flight! You have 100 very angry people with no luggage
@USAirways your customer service # has a recording that says we are to busy to assist and hangs up. Great touch. #poorservice @GMA @CBSNews
@JetBlue's CEO #pilots among ardent fans, Wall Street - Poughkeepsie Journal http://t.co/zSdGzyDNDe
@SouthwestAir my PR class would luv to know who's in charge of your Twitter. How many people write your tweets? #gracias
@JetBlue The Magic eight ball has never steered me wrong  :)
@united ...she said she would need to get a supervisor. While waiting for the supervisor she hung up on me.
@USAirways you can't even track my bag to see where it is. It's like it's disappeared.
@SouthwestAir flight to BOS Cancelled Flightled, no flights till TUESDAY, spent $1000 to get a flight through another airline + $170 for hotel. Refund
@JetBlue @amybruni No wifi on this flight so we can't tweet you our Oscar party pics at 37,000ft. #bluecarpet :-( SEA‚úàÔ∏èBOS
@JetBlue Thanks for the complimentary upgrade to first.  You are the best!
@USAirways Mobile boarding pass email.
@SouthwestAir pleasantly surprised to be boarding my flight on time this morning at @Fly_Nashville. Good job!
@united once again you guys didn't let me down, a four hour delay to Honolulu from Houston, thanks for the train wreck of issues now coming
@united y not? You're the reason we're in Houston and not NYC tonight. It took the plane an hour to take off - no explanations or sorry.
@SouthwestAir very disappointed in your customer service right now. definitely not feeling the luv. what's worse, 2nd time this winter.
@USAirways might possibly be THE WORST airline ever! I think it's time to brush up on customer service! #sorude
@united a good start would be  to warm the plane before the departure time so the flight isn't delayed due to frozen water lines.
@SouthwestAir hello #SouthwestAir I'm  happy to be flying with you this morning DAL-MDW #4053 looking forward to a comfortable fight
‚Äú@united: @4geiger It looks like form the photo that something burst out of your luggage. Is this correct? ^JH‚Äù always blame the customer
@SouthwestAir good thing we noticed because she had re-routed 7 total passengers on an impossible triple connection as well
@united cldnt be happier w the many plastic wing pins given to me on flight 494. I love them! Amazing staff! So nice http://t.co/CbV7f3KBKx
@SouthwestAir ohk. Thank You!!! B/C of the inexpensive airfares that Southwest has I can now travel around.
@AmericanAir bag turned up, no thanks to your useless call-centre and useless website
.@VirginAmerica not only was it great, but you return my calls the day after. Couldn't ask for more. #myVXexperience
@united Fingers crossed &amp; its all intact. Very disappointed with this experience as before this we were actually saying we enjoyed using you
@SouthwestAir any chance they will change this to include Northeast airports?  JetBlue has.
@JetBlue flight16?
@USAirways the two women workng PHL bag check term C @ 11:30 ET should be fired for being rude, pushy and treating customers with disrespect
@USAirways GF was on hold for 4 hours and call was dropped!!! HELP!!!!! Need a flight!!!
@USAirways you guys lost my luggage
@JetBlue Definitely! Lots of announcements and the app is great.
@SouthwestAir why is customer relations still not open....in Texas?!
@AmericanAir I did set up notifications through AA &amp; Us airways. still nothing
@USAirways hi is there somebody avail who can help .....with an refund ? its unbelievable on the phone w US for more than 7 hrs in 4 days
@SouthwestAir had an amazing experience with your staff at DIA last night. I was blown away by their hospitality with my wife on crutches
@JetBlue I‚Äôm going to miss a hugely important meeting because of your constant delays #itscostingmeincome
@SouthwestAir is there a resource to check delays/Cancelled Flightlations out of Love Field? Flying out tomorrow am and stressed about weather! ‚ùÑÔ∏è
@SouthwestAir I noticed the rates increased a few days ago, or the promotion ended. Any idea when another promotion will be coming?? Thanks!
@SouthwestAir oh and now your company has caused us to lose an entire day of our vacation in Cancun. De Boarded waiting for another plane
@USAirways couldn't be more thankful to your #orf and #dca crews on the ground and in the air today for help with a sick kid and a lost bag!
@JetBlue I've been in pricing for 8 years to know that 70 bucks a seat is criminal. 20-30 I understand. #pricing #flying #jetblue #pricewise
@JetBlue Haha you're doing everything right! Don't change a thing! Slash this Twitter engagement just makes you even cooler! #bestairline
@VirginAmerica soooo are you guys going to leave the seatbelt light on all flight? You can barely call this turbulence :-)
@United blocked me from DM'ing them because they would rather I complain about them in a public forum
@united u Cancelled Flighted my flight from IAD to JAX. Was supposed to use plane from BNA but u used that plane for another destination instead. 1/2
@USAirways Can you help me add a AAdvantage number and known traveler number to a reservation?
@VirginAmerica, @reallytallchris dropped a track on you... https://t.co/zv2pt6TRK9
@USAirways @AmericanAir pissing off thousands of East coast customers.  When the delay is longer than the flight,  you = fail
@AmericanAir my Mistake multibillion dollar company
@southwestair Landed an hour Late Flight from IND to DEN, and 40+ min Late Flightr, our bags are not here. Not cool.
@united rebooting Chicago dispatch system, need @pivotalcf as I'm tired of sitting on planes
@united I may not hit any new status this year, but I‚Äôve flown several times this year and have tried to book with y‚Äôall every time!
@AmericanAir all of these issues are not based on weather or things that are out of your control. These  issues are based on negligence.
@united please stop spending mktg $ on branding ads. Use savings to improve #cxp. 1hr wait for luggage due to short staff is unacceptable
@USAirways you can't control the weather but you can control customer service. Without luggage for 24 hours &amp; still yet to speak to a human.
@SouthwestAir any chance I can get tix for @VelourLive @Imaginedragons? I have been tweeting since January 26 about it #DestinationDragons
THANKS to @SouthwestAir , I get to go to the #DestinationDragons @Imaginedragons show this weekend in UTAH @VelourLive  !!! #ThankYou

@JetBlue I'd go to Portsmouth, NH to take care of my friend's son while she takes her daughter to Boston for surgery.  #flyingitforward
@AmericanAir This entire process took sooooo long that no decent seats are left.  #customerservice
@JetBlue not an issue but I think training &amp; information would help. Great ppl but service needs to switch from individual to group better
Haha! @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/KmaNLdQbh4‚Äù
@USAirways flight is delayed 5 hours. No reason given. Sure love flying with your airline. #whatajoke
@AmericanAir Not true!! Stop making excuses! You either overbook or have crappy planes!
@united You must follow me in order for me to send you a direct message if that is what you meant.
Keep it up :) @AmericanAir

@SouthwestAir what are the chances you will be Cancelled Flighting all flights in and out of Nashville again?
@united great flight into PVD. Smallest plane I have ever been on and smoothest landing ever!
@USAirways #flight4592 LET US OFF THIS PLANE!!!  please go to a gate.  This is absurd.
@USAirways I received a brochure in the mail touting all the benefits of the advantage card with usa now merged...baggage included
@SouthwestAir is the vinyl part of the prize too?
@USAirways the only time I tweet is to tell you how horrible you're attendants are. Flight 3841 to LGA. I feel in jail
@AmericanAir flight 1181 out of Vegas to DFW. Cancelled Flightled Sunday and Monday, no whammie today!
@USAirways how is it that the airport (DCA) and the airline mess up our flights, but also will not cover our hotel costs? At DCA for 5hrs...
@united  they were empty upon takeoff. Why can't someone sit there?
@JetBlue thanks! Have a good Sunday.
@AmericanAir why is there only one checkpoint open at JFK terminal 8? Ridiculous.
@united should have been able to get seat assign without paying $174 more - cust sec should have done that for me
@AmericanAir flight delayed 3 times today due to flight officer. 4333 from pit to ord. 5 hour delay to date. #bademployeeproblem?
@SouthwestAir right but the point was that my kids don't fly often, but I do. I bought four round trip tickets from DtW to PHX so I'm....
@SouthwestAir unveils 4 new #flights, including 2 from #Ohio http://t.co/grkBj7bxlk
@JetBlue never had an airline refuse to help sit parents with tiny kids. But this guy is willing to do it. #JetBlue http://t.co/MzZfGqfHu2
@SouthwestAir AMAZING c/s today by SW thank you SO very much. This is the reason we fly you #southwest
@United well sitting on the ground 'on time' but waiting for a gate....again #tiredofthis
@JetBlue did you know that suicide is the second leading cause of death among teens 10-24
@JetBlue Success! Good work JetBlue team
@JetBlue Gary who is serving us at FLL airport counter is really TRUE BLUE! Makes me feel at home even when a JetBlue flight is delayedl
@united Flight 2 is 2:30 hrs delayed so far b/c of Late Flight crew. Now we are literally waiting while they have dinner acc. to honest gate agent.
@United I have never been so grossed out in my life. What a disappointment-yet again-flying with you.
@SouthwestAir just sent you a DM w/ additonal info
@AmericanAir you really need some customer service training for your unhappy EEs in the morning in Chicago. Gate K20 at 430 chking her schd

@united #LAX #sunrise UAL212 LAX-JFK

@united after waiting for over an hour we finally board the airplane only to find out we have to call maintenance. And this plane is cold.üò°
@united sure... You've been saying that for as long as I've been tweeting about your obsolete fleet.  Promises are free.
@AmericanAir worst experience of my life avoid at all costs they will lose your belongings and have no humanity to even offer compensation
@JetBlue 's Once upon a sale that does not include BTV, as usual!  #jetbluehatesbtv
@AmericanAir Thanks so much!
@VirginAmerica is the best airline I have flown on.Easy to change your reservation,helpful representatives &amp; a comfortable flying experience
@JetBlue I've heard your new in flight tap to pay readers accept ONLY Apple Pay. I thought that was impossible &amp; certainly not EMV compliant
@united don't know if you are aware that ALL of your premier access lines are closed in your terminal. I feel the love.
@USAirways  I have 3 times and no one has been able to help me out
@JetBlue #jetblue #sofly #wish #firststari seetonight http://t.co/pyJAoayNx6
@USAirways on time today and from PHL! Nice work! #ThereIsAFirstForEverything
@AmericanAir great thank you
@VirginAmerica Had to spend 5 hours worrying that items in carryon would be broken/stolen since I couldn't carry them on plane or lock bag.
@USAirways claimed my flight Cancelled Flighted because PHL runway not good but Delta flight at same exact time is taking off on time.
@SouthwestAir what does relay concerns really mean &amp; how/why do u keep letting people on flights with bags larger than u state are allowabl?
@AmericanAir You should really help @Cowboycerrone out, you are getting a TON of bad publicity right now #WillNeverFlyWithYou
@SouthwestAir and @USAirways have Cancelled Flightled flights after 525 pm today due to winter storm. Travelers urged to contact carrier for info.
@AmericanAir thanks for the great customer service. Family made it back to SAT safely. The weather at DFW made things a little worrisome.
@JetBlue Thank you for the quick response! I am trying to request abassinet for my son. it would be great if you can help me with my request
@SouthwestAir, got "duped" w/ a connection on 1st flight (sneaky), now u won't give me a seat on an earlier flight w/ availability. Shameful
@AmericanAir 37 minutes??????
@united yes of course I have.  Is this how you treat customer with no recourse?
@JetBlue do you know when the schedule for dec 2015 will be released?
@AmericanAir Are you people cruel or just stupid? Why are you posting my personal email on the damn Internet? Have u lost your mind?!
@AmericanAir great job TYR ground crew...now let's get this bird outta here!!!  Tell flight 3200 to wait on me...be there in 45 mikes!
@AmericanAir Always enjoy my time. Now on the plane to DFW!
@united seriously #fail on making strangers share a room
@SouthwestAir is there any way me &amp; my best friend could get tickets to #DestinationDragons ? they mean everything in the world to us.
@AmericanAir Disappointing lack of kindness toward this person. The agent asked her counterparts "why this person was talking to her".
@USAirways it's unacceptable the way your agents at the gate treat paying customers!!!
@AmericanAir still waiting on a dm response..... #sloooowresponses
@USAirways testing my patience this evening (or shall I say morning?). We waited an hour at the gate for you to find a gate agent.  130am
@United is the best way to re-unite me with my one true love, shopping in USA's fashion capital #NewYork #unitedVUSA http://t.co/rBn7StUij1
@AmericanAir The flight is the wrong day. Confirm # USXLON. Departure on 5/21 should be 5/22 for 2 people
@SouthwestAir on hold for 2 hours and then you hung up 3 Cancelled Flightled flights. Running out of daycare for our kids who are trapped at home.
@SouthwestAir I'm showing flight 4720 delayed again. Would my boarding pass still be good or was my seat given away?
@AmericanAir We've sent you more info via DM.  I truly hope you resolve this very quickly. #media #filmcrew #cnn #nbc
@AmericanAir @robinreda being stuck two days in the airport is not something pretty normal. I am positive you can find a plane to Europe
@united Stuck on plane for over an hour due to mechanical faults. Any updates please? This happened on way to Newark and now again to LHR...
@USAirways &amp; @AmericanAir: 1 flight Cancelled Flightled yesterday and now a delay today has robbed my daughter of 2 days with her grandparents. Thanks
@JetBlue to start 3xweekly @EmbraerSA #E190 flights from #Washington Reagan to #Nantucket between 19JUN-6SEP #avgeek
Well lets see.  You could pay for my Negroni with bitcoin. @JetBlue
.@united all other ANA ticket holders get to use the lounge, too. But not us. Because United booked us. #grumpykim
@SouthwestAir Denver to Phoenix, I think we're finally getting ready to take off.
@AmericanAir  my fly is 1579  if do you have some news
@JetBlue I can't. I don't have acces to a phone rn. My iPhone broke. :/ would rather change it now then Late Flightr.
@JetBlue flying to Denver March 1st and my flight itenary keeps getting changed what the heck...booked the trip 3 months ago
@AmericanAir 48 hours and still no bag. Could have flown to Costa Rica and back by now. I had gifts for my family in my bags.
@united #onlyinAmerica. 18 days and not a word from #unitedairlines #customerservices. Bad PR guys.
@USAirways surprisingly quick response time by you and them. Thanks!
@USAirways Call volumes are high so the best answer is to hang up on me?
@AmericanAir employees are racist!!!!!
@SouthwestAir How's Dallas incoming looking? I'm scheduled to fly in at 10:30 and wondering if I'll be stuck in St. Louis instead.
@united yes but taking two days to get bag delivered. Missed a full day skiing because of this.
@JetBlue I'm disappointed my flight was Cancelled Flighted, mostly because I was excited to listen to the song "I'm Blue" while flying on JetBlue.
@united I am appalled at your lack of communication during our awful journey on 2/21 EWR to BOS. 4 hr delays need to be explained better.
@united whats UA 1205 lax - newark ??
@united customer service has no solution and now we might miss a show because of them
@SouthwestAir thx for smooth landing today @fly2midway, we applauded! Now what can u do abt the weather? #takemeback http://t.co/OQZ7Wc4lLA
@JetBlue Awesome! Thank you! ;)
@AmericanAir oh it can get better apparently. After making us wait for a gate, psych!! Now we need you to de-ice before coming to the gate!!
@AmericanAir  MY FLIGHT #2962 OUT OF CLL @ 0600 WON'T LET ME CHECK IN. PLEASE HELP. #IMPORTANTFLIGHT
@united Can you tell me Jet Airways award availability?
@Jetblue  I will keep on tweeting until your CEO answers and personally apologizes to my wife and the passengers of flight 136. Just Wrong!!
@JetBlue No, he didn't have more info. I was more infuriated by the way previous rep treated me. how she can possibly work as a JetBlue rep?
@united UA1740. 4.5 hr mechanical delay all I get is $50 voucher? Will tweet when I book next trip not on UA.
@JetBlue Flight 1533 JFK to Cartagena all at this airport bar singing the opposite of your praises! We're making a pact to never fly u again
@USAirways @landonschott he's fine, he really likes picking his own seat....
@united Lovely new plane from LGA to ORD but no power outlets?
@JetBlue Received an invitation to participate in e-rewards. Is this legit from JetBlue? Just double checking bc the site looked different.
@SouthwestAir extremely #disappointed with poor the customer service provided after Cancelled Flighting my flight today! #unprofessional
@SouthwestAir on hold for over an hour twice?  Terrible.
@AmericanAir so, what should he do next exactly?!
@AmericanAir I have been on hold w/customer service line for 68 minutes.  This after I was on phone with an agent for 35 min b/f call droped
@united here is my case id 8473573. Requested on 2/5, now it's 2/19... 7-10 days I'll get a response, BS!
@SouthwestAir love how you hold flight 2851 in PHX for Late Flight passengers and make us all over an hour Late Flight. Great job.
@AmericanAir 1hr 46 min. Cost of flight change $788. Was $188 2hrs ago b/f drop call. Cancelled Flighted flight. Asked 4 refund.
@AmericanAir many trips coming up!  I will see you soon üòÉ
@united @CheerTymeDad So I can buy tix 3 days before flight but can't transfer the tix.  Flawed security logic. Flawed customer service
Need more info on that! @united: @momsgoodeats We have great amenity kits. PJ's not included. We status match AA. ^KP‚Äù
@JetBlue Wish Everyone felt like you
@USAirways HORRIBLE communication on delayed flight out of LGA!!!! I got 2 emails in seconds w different delay times!!!! HORRIBLE
@VirginAmerica Can you find us a flt out of LAX that is sooner than midnight on Monday? That would be great customer service üòÉ
@AmericanAir which one.?i have been booked on 6 different ones in the past 2 days
@united yes, after landing at 930pm last night. Spoke to 10 baggage claim customer service reps. Finally spoke to one amazing ticket agent.
@USAirways you are absolutely terrible at managing these delays... Been delayed and undelayed and delayed 6 times now. 10 AM office hours.
I feel completely cheated @united. I read your commitment to customer service via website and def did not get service suggested there.
@SouthwestAir thanks for the ride to Chicago. #kmdw #b738 http://t.co/6cpYPGFnD6
@USAirways - First impressions are hard to reverse.  A horrible first experience with you.  Will never fly with you again!!!
@USAirways what is with all the Cancelled Flightlations to PBI? We have pax at DCA that have been sent to 4 different lines between AAL and AWE. Help!
‚Äú@united: @BattierCCIpuppy We hope to see you on board soon and thanks for the tweet. ^EY‚Äù üëèüëè
@united Based on suggestions from other passengers I have a rental car on standby for 11:30.  One way or another will be leaving then.
@SouthwestAir when can we expect customer service in Dallas to be available
@SouthwestAir Late Flightly you've always been Late Flight! Please get back to the old #SWA!!
@JetBlue is so sloooooow today
@SouthwestAir and now no wifi??? Come on.
@AmericanAir Hi, can you please ticket my award ticket? The status is "On Request" now. Thanks.
@USAirways  Flight 4454 aircraft at gate, but no crew?  Will be 2+ hours Late Flight to destination. Come on!
@AmericanAir been trying to speak to agent for 24hrs about my Cancelled Flightled flight but reps always busy. how do I get ahold of you?
@AmericanAir Fuck you.
@united you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016
@USAirways Please hold US1765 for me. Need to get home tonight before weather. Almost there.
@united no u don't
@SouthwestAir now flying non stop CMH-OAK has me daydreaming about a trip to the bay...especially in this weather. #OhioProbz
@JetBlue really not acceptable. Just informed plane won't start. Chartering bus to take passengers to jfk.
Please don't. RT ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/gdzadXzBYA‚Äù
@JetBlue yes, please get me the seats we paid for.
@USAirways @AmericanAir I'm in the #finalstretch to #chairman #execplat #mileagerun for 6k needed any suggestions? #letsgo!
@USAirways lots of fun to be removed from top of a list and manually readded to the bottom thanks to club agents. Thanks a lot Asha at DCA.
@united I think you should board from the back of the plane #whatstheholdup #CHItoCLE
@JetBlue I want you guys to be the first to fly to #Cuba, from NYC.
@JetBlue customer service was so bad updating my points, once I use my next points, I won't be flying you. Point system is almost a sham.
@SouthwestAir I DM'd you
@USAirways @HirasmusBidragi will try.. Now stuck on tarmac waiting on gate. :( may miss 9:25 connection #883)
@USAirways through, can you confirm that I haven't been charged?
@united @JedediahBila Why is United voted every year as one of the worst airlines? Do enjoy that title? You should give Jedediah free passes
@AmericanAir could you check if there is SVU space on AA199 MXP-JFK Feb 28th? Thanks
@jetblue captain "takes as lot of muscles to frown but JUST A FEW TO SMILE. Y'all ready to go flyin?" I mean... Now I am!
@SouthwestAir would be cool if the best airlines company hooked me up with @Imaginedragons tickets for Vegas ;)
@VirginAmerica Results Handily Exceed Forecasts - @NYTimes http://t.co/gonmRwEM6I
@AmericanAir where do I look for cabin crew vacancies?
@united yea they been booked on 10 next avalible flights since sat 7am. And when time comes no plane 2nd day of work missed #hotelliving
@united so you told me to go, knowing what the issue was, only for me to go there and find out that you won‚Äôt fix it?
@AmericanAir not in any way that I am happy with or find acceptable.   If I could speak to a human maybe that would happen
@JetBlue I have an email that says I have to sign on to the travel bank?  How do I that?
@USAirways tooooo many Cancelled Flightations! My chain of command hates me now
@AmericanAir I'd just like to know where my bag is, when I'll get it and why I don't have it already. No accountability from Cust Service.
@SouthwestAir adds new direct flights from #Columbus to Oakland &amp; Boston starting August 2015 #cmh #oak #bos
@JetBlue 162, SMF to JFK!
@united OK, thanks for the clarification.
@SouthwestAir why do your MDW gates have so many fewer seats than your planes?
@USAirways where's my bag?  You called at noon promising it today, would like an update like your website promises.  I need that bag!
@USAirways 4914 from PHL to BGM. I cannot believe this has happened 2x in under two weeks!
@united I send you an urgent message via eservice@united.com.  BG0KWM   Narayanan. Please respond ASAP. Also, NO local United Tel # @ KUL
@AmericanAir that's quite an impressive list of fees!
@SouthwestAir schedule is open through the end of October, got Columbus day wknd in New England for ~50K points for 4! Check your calendar!
@USAirways Cancelled Flightled the last part of a ticket and am confused from the email I received whether value remains. Is there someone I can ask?
@AmericanAir you should really explain customer service to your gate agent for 1152 at C4. Couldn't be bothered.
@JetBlue today my family gets to experience #mosaic status w/ me! #LifeIsGood
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/Vxn2J36M7V‚Äù this happened
@SouthwestAir @geekstiel Do you know when the last chance is?
@SouthwestAir sent DM
@united you are offering us 8 rooms for 32 people #FAIL
@SouthwestAir What's up with the wait times on your customer service line? Tried 2X on Fri. and now I've been on for over 15 min.
@SouthwestAir Does anyone ever answer your phone? #poor
@USAirways we had a friend there telling the gate attendant and the stewardess what was going on #notourfaultyoudontuseyourgatesright
@AmericanAir @nrosenb1 it says changes can't be made online
@JetBlue is the worst. I have to postpone my trip and they can't accommodate guests like @SouthwestAir #NeverAgain
@SouthwestAir almost 2 hours on hold, 2 hours of my life I can't get back.... Thanks http://t.co/IyUZM2PUVS
.@united Our newest delay, right now http://t.co/96fTLZWtvO
@SouthwestAir why are yall trying to fly me to Chicago when I don't live there?! Send me home now!!!! Bullshit ass customer service
@SouthwestAir thanks! I expected a wait... Just not that long. :)
@AmericanAir guys 5350 in dfw  stuck at the gate for half an hour.  Do we pull the slide or what?
@JetBlue She claimed that she did, but I was not happy with the way I was treated.
@USAirways is okay for u 2 Cancelled Flight change a flight when good 4 u but you cant logistically figure out what 2 do when a plane comes in on time
@united lost my parents luggage to cancun, said it would be delivered to hotel by 7PM, it is now almost 11PM
@USAirways going to miss my connection due to another tarmac delay - on US5268 then 4050 - need a flight home today please!
@SouthwestAir still on the ground &gt;30mins after planned departure. And this is California. No weather here. Originally told 10 min delay.
@AmericanAir aa223 being ignored
@SouthwestAir hope your flyers get a credit of some sort for all the delays and Cancelled Flightlations #shittydeal #notimpressed
@AmericanAir Jacquelyn at Charlotte just denied me compensation after #2251 was Cancelled Flighted due to plane malfunction well within your control
@VirginAmerica Never had a bad experience before, but this one took the cake. Now extortion for carry on items as well?
.@SouthwestAir thx for the note. Flight was Cancelled Flightled and today is all booked so had to go with another carrier. :(
@AmericanAir they did tell that our luggage stayed inside the plane ! Look this video http://t.co/YokkHHQcMP
@AmericanAir @jokerunning this happened to me too!!!
@united we are sitting on the runway for 2 hours! It is ridiculous!!
@USAirways we've now learned to never fly with u again. You've lost 16 customers from our group + the hundreds more from our company
@SouthwestAir customer svc worse than the #WinterWeather !  Flight Cancelled Flighted, website malfunction, on hold for &gt;1:34. http://t.co/PgwUkrpMOx
@united Can you transfer my bags too?
@united Fantastic job by your people today on ua22 from Dublin. A jam packed plane but the crew was wonderful!!
@USAirways US 728/Feb 21 Hour 6 on plane when US Airways representative Kim Y enters deteriorating picture. Unhelpful with no assurances.
@SouthwestAir I've been on hold for 2 hours!  When will you answer??
@USAirways Why not have an option for a call back? I'm just sitting here burning through my minutes waiting for an error to be fixed.
@USAirways they say connections are good still...but another reFlight Booking Problems is the last thing I need today
Only 14 biz days (18 calendar) to respond to my inquiry @united ?  I hope your standards are universally adopted :-/ #BadCustomerService
@JetBlue is your partnership with Hawaiian live? Earn Hawaiian miles flying Jetblue ? IF so, how do I add @HawaiianAir to my JB Flight Booking Problems ?
@AmericanAir I am dealing with the reFlight Booking Problems agent in the Miami airport now
@USAirways I left something on a recent flight today. Who do I contact to retrieve it please? Thanks!
@JetBlue it's sunny and gorgeous in ny actually. What's the real reason?
@united rarely ceases to amaze...for the worse.  i hope this is the last time i "have" to fly with you.
@united Thanks, I will!
@VirginAmerica shame on VA for making people spend money in stranded cities when other airlines are landing at JFK! Who will reimburse me?
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flightled 2 of my flights for maintenance. Customer service desk is empty... Can I get a hotel at least? http://t.co/ypbkCiRBXu
@SouthwestAir this is ridiculous. It's been 2 hours on hold to rebook Cancelled Flightled flight.
@united It's a shame choosing #United may be the difference between reuniting with aging friends and never seeing them again #PoorService
@united b/c of your delay now you are oversold by 14 passengers?!??? This is a mess! What are you going to do to compensate?
@united OKC ticket agent Roger McLarren(sp?) LESS than helpful with our Intl group travel problems Can't find a supervisor for help.
@VirginAmerica I spoke with a representative that offered no solution, I am a loyal customer who flies on @VirginAtlantic as well
@SouthwestAir  Just left there  Friday!
@USAirways is there  anyway to get rebook in help on twitter?
@AmericanAir Thanks gang! Mind if I ask, do you handle all of your Social Media in house?
@USAirways is a joke. Stop losing my luggage!
@united should NOT sell tickets for @SilverAirways on http://t.co/onhXHCO6bK.  has terrible service and UA staff cannot reach Silver
@VirginAmerica your mobile site is broken, shows "{{header.elevateUser.numOfPointsAvailable || '0' | number}} Points", won't let me checkin
@united I'll stick with my United flight. Thanks, though. Effort is much appreciated.
@USAirways 603 &amp; 2705 DFW to PSP thank you!
@SouthwestAir NOW you love me? After taking my money and only taking me halfway home. Sorry. Too Late Flight
@AmericanAir all flights Cancelled Flighted tomorrow and that means I'm stranded at the airport for the night... wow.
@JetBlue no excuse though for 3 gate changes though.
@JetBlue too Late Flight. Several passengers are inebriated. You're in league with big alcohol. Shame on you.
@AmericanAir have such a bad rep for loosing costumers luggage. I stopped flying them a while back.
Not your fault @JetBlue Social Media Awesome People. I know everyone is working hard to get us in our way.
@SouthwestAir y'all the real MVP with these prices...
@united you need to follow me I order for me to DM....
@SouthwestAir flight 3970, bna-rdu had the most excellent crew today
@USAirways ~45 minutes means no public transit home and an expensive cab. Promises doesn't make up for it
@USAirways 4 great flights with no delays! Thank you!
@AmericanAir do you have hand sanitizer in the bathrooms on your flights?
@AmericanAir attached original ticket. flight number was 1672. isn't the experience I thought I would have. Terrible! http://t.co/5SdlyN9MSS
@AmericanAir 4 open kiosks for priority with no line and only 4 open for main check in for ~80-100 ppl
@SouthwestAir paid for my own $200 rental car just to not go through this for the 3rd day  :(
@AmericanAir improve Envoy's performance.  5th trip through ORD in 2015 I've been delayed for hours because of Envoy.  I could drive faster!
@Usairways need to learn operations. Sit a plane overnight at #gsp, and not realize there's a mech problem. Then delay flight 3 1/2 hours!
@SouthwestAir would you be willing to help me surprise my bestfriend with tickets to go see @Imaginedragons? #DestinationDragons Gracias!
@JetBlue serious attitude. I was in the fault for running a tad behind but before she even knew my name or my flight info she ASSURED Me
@SouthwestAir I would be eternally grateful for tickets to the Vegas show ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) God bless
@AmericanAir extra night we have to stay in San Juan now. How can I check on that?
@JetBlue I'm on flt 700 lax to FLL both ppl are sleeping so Id rather not disturb in flight. Tried to dl movie no go http://t.co/Nh2i9ZlzMk
@AmericanAir @_Lucy_May surely much better to let us all share the feedback unless you have something to hide?
@AmericanAir message and pics sent...
@JetBlue I cri
@USAirways Will do. I appreciate the response.
@SouthwestAir do you have any info about when #DestinationDragons winners will be announced? me &amp; my best friend are hoping to win. thanks!
@SouthwestAir extremely frustrating travel experience in Denver! Instead of landing in SEA on Saturday, now it's Monday afternoon!
@JetBlue also. My party { me and my sister and mom} are on three separate reservations. Will TSA lets us go through together or alone.
@AmericanAir @Delta Maybe? Long trip, Late Flight night &amp; queues at baggage claims in two terminals, no good. I thought I paid for it 50$ instead.
@SouthwestAir it's not disappointment, it's a blatant disregard for your business select customers, it's becoming a problem that's pushing
@VirginAmerica question: is it not possible to book a seat for an infant under 2? It's not giving me the option but we want a seat for him.
@USAirways Congrats, you've just lost a customer for good. When I made a United weather change, free/5 min. You guys 2 hrs on hold &amp; $25.
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/XX5QSCjlL1‚Äù @BrandsSayingBae #Freberg15
@SouthwestAir thanks, but they told him he couldn‚Äôt a few hours ago, then my plane left  after I tried to do it. Stuck waiting for hours now
@VirginAmerica @ChrysiChrysic your assistance yesterday when u Cancelled Flightled our flight was to give us a hotel hotline  Shame on you!
@SouthwestAir good to be back. See you all again in several weeks.
@united 4994 out of Jackson, Wyoming... Delayed by no pilots.. Full toilets.. Deplaned 2ndary to mechanical fail.. Cancelled Flightled flight pending
@SouthwestAir I am trying to change a ticket for travel on Monday that cannot be changed online. Anyway faster than waiting on hold? #anhour
@united On flight 1220 right now...
@JetBlue PR-friendly tweets don't help drive accountability. Hope Mr. Hayes takes note.
@JetBlue Thanks for the reminder of a few older flights I'd taken and the easy access to add points to my new JB account! Awesome service.
@USAirways and now that flight pushed back to 2:35pm departure.
As am I, @AmericanAir - but thankfully there was a @united lounge next door. Really not impressed by oneworld partnerships :(
@VirginAmerica Good point!
@united remember in business, a pleasant experience, means you will tell a friend. A bad experience means you will tell everyone you see
@USAirways download jeokoo the American app for air travelers
@united we would...how do I contact you to discuss? A few poor experiences with customer service but would give it a shot!
@AmericanAir lets me get in line for call back in over 2 hours. I'll just hope the 1 ticket left on the flight I want is still there Late Flightr.
@JetBlue @markie_post I'd like to see Markie too.
@USAirways Eh, it happens. I think I'll survive. üòâ Thanks!
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/5xGnyHGAFz‚Äù this is what I hate
@United Is Changing Its #MileagePlus Program: Winners and Losers http://t.co/38OTLzAK5d #airline #travel #loyalty #rewards
@JetBlue #1408 IAD to JFK still hasn't boarded. What's today's excuse and how am I gonna get to work?
@united then watched my connecting flight in DEN pull away from the gate only to pull into THE SAME gate. #SlapInTheFace
@USAirways he is 8 months old and is suffering from a rare form of cancer. Your customer service agents had no compassion and I am disgusted
@SouthwestAir needs to offer a college student discount so i can fly home üò≠üò≠
@JetBlue Can't view seat selection/change seat for flight tomorrow. Can you look into this?
@AmericanAir looks like I have. Best I can hope for I guess. It's on us air, so I don't think I'll get miles on Alaska. Which sucks.
@USAirways how do I change flights . 3 hours is crazy please help
@SouthwestAir discount for three delays?
@AmericanAir Hey Becky Piela at the Orange County airport has been really kind and helpful with rescheduling our flight!
@united I locked myself out of my account and needed access to book a flight.
@AmericanAir gotta love those skycaps, solving problems faster than anyone else in the terminal. And they did it with a smile on their face
@AmericanAir Bad weather happens. But not being able to get through to a reservations rep for over 6 hours is just crazy. #frustrated
@united had been suffering immensely ever since this merge .. Hopefully I'll never have to fly @united ever again ..
@united @perfectomobile huh?  I have sent 16 crash reports in Feb alone.  8 in one day.  Only app I have that consistently crashes.
@united Thanks! I'll fill up the form as soon as I land. I don't like being duped so I hope you will appreciate my feedback &amp; will be better
@USAirways yes, with Delta!
@USAirways : i have been trying to reach dividend miles  to extend my ticket for last 3 days , 20 + calls and i get a message to call back
@SouthwestAir Thank you. I know ya'll can't control the weather. I appreciate ya'll working to get my flight rebooked the last two days.
@USAirways I understand that, and when I'm attempting to change the information so they are identical, it tells me to call a #
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flights my flight, doesn't send an email, text or call. Now I'm stranded in Louisville.
@SouthwestAir companion pass please!
Hey @united you've upgraded me on a 10 hour International flight. I forgive you :-) thank you!
@AmericanAir Hey, AA! There was a mistake made by your CR on my Flight Booking Problems. When I call your reservations #, I keep getting hung up on. Advise.
@AmericanAir lost my wife's luggage and nobody gives you and answer, all they say is go here or call there.
@united wins top marks for customer service via Twitter. They turned a poor experience into a positive. Many thanks for the effort! üëç
@United now what?!? http://t.co/5hpSqVRjK8 flight was gone when I got off plane! #BusinessTravel #goodenoughmother
@JetBlue Yoga it is. TV service seems to be down though :-(I look forward to that do much!
@VirginAmerica Random Q: what's the distribution of elevate avatars? I bet that kitty has a disproportionate share http://t.co/APtZpuROp4
@SouthwestAir so u guys Cancelled Flight #bna flights &amp; don't bother 2 alert passengers? What gives?
@AmericanAir I spent $600 on my flight. Could have gone on @united for $382 but their mileage program sucks.
@united As it always is. Helps to communicate to customers.
@SouthwestAir can y'all develop Ding for a chrome/Firefox browser extension? That would be swell
@united thanks. Weather is understandable, but when every single domestic flight is delayed because of inbound int'l flights, it's crazy
@united WTF!?!? Delay after delay. 15 hours YVR to SAN? Unacceptable. Flight Crew Availability is to blame? NEVER AGAIN with @united
@united gives Belfast a #Hug with the new unmissable #BusHug format #impact #busads #thinkbus @BelfastAirport http://t.co/AvbdstJUJS
@JetBlue I hear that the new thing in your planes are the Fly-Fi. How I can check if the flight that Im going to take have it?
@SouthwestAir can take u to Midway-Chicago March 8th-April 6th. Can't make it then? @AmericanAir can get u to @fly2ohare year round. #FlyPBI
@united delayed agAin by United. Gate agent was borderline rude when I asked her a flight status question. What is happening to United?
@USAirways Thanks. It would be better from the gate agent at C14 in Charlotte boarding flight 1791.
@AmericanAir got call saying flight Cancelled Flightled but checked online and it isn't Cancelled Flightled. No where near bad weather. I have job interview
@SouthwestAir I will be calling someone on Monday in customer relations. Very disappointed in how I was treated by customer service!
@USAirways ok thanks
@united I need you to get my cousin to PDX, she's on 2 days of travel now and we've had to hire other sitters til she arrives, thx for that

@USAirways is it ok for a flight attendant to talk nasty about passengers while they go get drinks by the restroom? I was shocked listening
@VirginAmerica Are there any plans for a short haul airline in Europe? Would defiantly fly with you guys :)
@united, wife landed in DC 5hrs ago. luggage did not, was told it would B delivered/Hotel by 8pm. It's now 10pm, no luggage. #UA484
‚Äú@united: @MelanieSpring We'll see what we can do. ^KN‚Äù We are running! Most of this plane is running. Thanks for the help!
@AmericanAir thanks for making this the worst flying experience ever. 4 different planes of mechanical issues and 12 hours and counting
@AmericanAir @ezemanalyst why don't you tweet canned, impersonal responses as though this is the only impatient customer you've got
@USAirways on hold for 1hr, 30min. Not willing to hang in there as long as @franchise02. @AmericanAir answered in 7 min. U are not 1 yet.
‚Äú@USAirways: Reminder: From 2/28, we‚Äôll be tweeting from @AmericanAir. You should join us: http://t.co/WBMHRl3bvl

@united Thanks JT
@AmericanAir @dotnetnate Two hour wait for EXPs as I sit on a JFK PHX flight because US computers are down. Any shot at an LAX flight?
@SouthwestAir you're 4/4 on blowing it with your customer service. Shotwest Airlines.
@VirginAmerica adds Austin-Dallas Love Field route. http://t.co/XWJoL55FLH http://t.co/Y8AOrMfkaC
@AmericanAir You can't even get someone on the phone. Great story for the media.

@SouthwestAir been on hold for an hour. I need to rebook my flight that was Cancelled Flighted! #help
@SouthwestAir today you sporadically changed my flight departure 5 times &amp; left two hours Late Flight. Uncharacteristic of u http://t.co/TXhYJ40llG
@AmericanAir this has to be the absolute WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!
@united  Thanks for nothing! No Atlanta Lounge? Your Ap says NO. Sure nothing at Terminal T http://t.co/tFjfMSHa2k
@united Flight attendant never served me my beverage (tea), and not once checked up on me. What gives? #ua6076 #notcool
@AmericanAir - gold elite loyalty customer..can't count on my hometown preferred airline to do right. #bummed..

@USAirways what's going on with passengers diverted to CLT on FLL to PHL flight that left at 830 tonight?
@united thank you.. Appreciate the response
@united your "customer service" team in manilla is absolute shit. I can't even get a supervisor without being out back on hold?!
@USAirways @AmericanAir I'm a chairman who was in 1st class on both my flights today. System Cancelled Flightled my tickets and kicked me out of 1st.
@AmericanAir, I've been booked on the wrong flight! And now PE desk has a wait of more than 2 hours?!
@AmericanAir flight Cancelled Flighted! I'm trying to get to #chicago. What are me and @justynmoro gonna do. #flying#flight#travel
@united he is so excellent and so reliable :) #happycustomer
@SouthwestAir Your Terry is our hero! Got my husband back thru security to retrieve cellphone left on plane in Austin. Terry #85832 U Rock!
@JetBlue hello! my husband bought us a trip last night &amp; just noticed my last name is misspelled! What can I do? Thanks!
@united airlines: you kidding? Bagage lost this morning from ny to Washington and still no trace? #badservice
@JetBlue yes! Announced we will take off. You're on it! Thank you!
@AmericanAir ok makes no sense tho Since you'll give me a free upgrade to first.
@USAirways I have a MAJOR complaint that I want to address w/you about my hand luggage courtesy check-in. What's the best way to do this?
@SouthwestAir I know that not everybody on flight can be 1st time flying. But in case it is people in front deplane 1st not from the back?!?
@SouthwestAir same here. Would appreciate a follow so I can DM my info to figure out what I am supposed to do.
@VirginAmerica your no Late Flight bag check just lost you my business. I missed flight and AM apt. Three other people on flight had same exp.
@united I can't find any Late Flight evening flights. Are there other airports that would have an overnight flight?
@united yes I did. Terrible service from your courrier
@JetBlue Looking cool
@AmericanAir westjet and your rep won't do anything about my lost luggage- which I never even checked with westjet because it was lost in
@united what a long day of delays. Please get us to Dallas tonight!!!!  Fingers crossed!!!  #winterstorm2015 #whichisworsedenordfw.
@united  Need to change flight from this Tuesday to sooner to attend to ailing parent in FL, Need help!! #custserv
@AmericanAir I guess that is your way of saying thanks for sharing but I can't help you, Good Luck. Happy Birthday to me. Ugh
@SouthwestAir  I sent a email to customer relations and I will be calling tomorrow.
@AmericanAir I tried that. They won't book us with another airline. I wish I had flown with you! We are now stuck in FL til Weds.
@AmericanAir how do I talk to an actual person that will help me, and do what you guys should do?
@USAirways color me confused but why would i need to call and do this. Update your procedures and policies. You can see who is connecting
@united my flight landed 50 min, but we are being told to stay on the plane, haven't pulled up to the gate &amp; have little to no information.
@united should hire extra customer service reps. 50 minute wait time to ask one question? I would rather just fly another airline, thanks.
@united Very impressed so far. An app that's worth a damn and sms updates on my flight.
@JetBlue I can't call right now. My baby just fell asleep.
@USAirways thanks Travis at PHL A East checkin for knowing baggage policies. Skis &amp; boots count as 1. Teach your mgr who didn't know
@SouthwestAir crew of WN3946 SAN-SFO was brilliant! Rita was hilarious. I know I've been down on you before, but this was a great flight
@USAirways thanks! Made it safely! http://t.co/KCqeBEej7S
@united  @DENAirport United 787 in snowy Denver. http://t.co/w1AaKJumXA
@united thank you for the reply.  I will fill out the form and submit it as requested.  Good to know you're paying attention!
@JetBlue great will do once I land in JFK
@southwestair does anyone realize that banning peanuts on a flight due to an allergic person ignores p-nut oil &amp; dust from previous flights?
@SouthwestAir is making dreams come true with their #DestinationDragons scavenger hunt! You can win a chance to see Imagine Dragons! Go!
@JetBlue They did not have any &amp; asked if I wanted tea. How do you have tea&amp;not coffee? I'm a gold on United &amp; coffee I nvr think 2x about
@USAirways Get new planes then. Got on this plane at 7:50 its 10:20 now and still on tarmac. How ru going to compensate me for this?
@USAirways I need to speak with a live person. I've had it with the recordings. I was told on Sat that we'd have our luggage by yest.
@AmericanAir I used the "call back" feature with an operator regarding my flight, got a call 2 hours Late Flightr and got hung up on. #pleasehelp
@united Every United flight between Saipan and Guam is an adventure! You never know when @CapeAir's old plane will be operational :)
@VirginAmerica Having an issue finding a missing item on a plane. Can you help me find which airport my plane headed to next?
@JetBlue Can you tell me which days you fly direct BUF - FLL and FLL - BUF?
@united. Please get me an economy plus seat. Awful day of 2 Cancelled Flighted flights, after lots of planning.
@JetBlue Only wish your ground operation was as expedient as your Twitter response team! Delay just got extended!
@VirginAmerica awaiting my return phone call, just would prefer to use your online self-service option :(
@USAirways FINALLY leaving 4 home from NC. Will lodge respectful complaints!! Mechanical issue after cleared for runway? #5hourwait #nocrew
@united, we've been waiting for over an hour for our luggage- what gives?
@united Thank you for the speedy response! I figured it may be something of that nature. You guys and your "fine print," haha
@jetblue I'm dissapointed in the way paseengers on flight 0510 in Santo Domingo have been treated. 9hrs to board the plane and no info given
@AmericanAir  I have still not talked to anyone. You guys should be prepared for these situations. How is this good service? I am so mad!!!
@united there are at least 3 of us on UA1564 at ORD waiting to deplane to catch UA4232 to CLT. Any chance of waiting to last second for us?
@JetBlue don't just cling on to the safety card. It safety was really an issue, then flight would have landed immediately. .
@SouthwestAir Seriously, is the reason for all the Cancelled Flightled flights and long phone wait times that you guys are tremendously understaffed?
@SouthwestAir @Kaneshow @InternJohnRadio @mrerickv THIS IS EVERYTHING... now, return that jet so we can go to Miami!
@USAirways AA Gate Supervisor emplid 600117 allowed flight AA67 to leave JFK to SJ on 20feb15 w/o 8 customers that made final boarding call.
@USAirways so it's a $25.00 bag fee for a golf bag on a domestic flight?
@JetBlue will we be able to watch the Oscars on our flight tomorrow?
@USAirways @JosephTReis Can't believe advice to call customer service. I was on hold for 3 hrs this morning and finally gave up.
@united need to work on your #United #flierfriendly program. At the very least, clue in your flight attendants.
@AmericanAir would it be possible to change my flight on your website? Many thanks
@JetBlue pls send an IT tech 2 baggage office. Poor guy is trying 2 print my claim &amp; can't. I need 2 get home. Upgrade 2 @HP printers MFPs
@VirginAmerica That's classy.
@united smiling? NOT!!
@united I can't even fit my name on the first two lines, yes... Please do pass on feedback. This is a big downgrade from previous years.
@SouthwestAir I need to request a refund on my flight that was Cancelled Flightled this morning due to the weather.
@SouthwestAir I would like to ask that his bags be picked up at PIT &amp; taken to his hotel by the airport. Will someone contact me
@AmericanAir Yes, but should be able to get a push notification via the app if I‚Äôm logged in and on a trip. Email/text is so 2010 üò•.
@United is freaking worthless. I hate this airline. http://t.co/dN1if2cGwE
@AmericanAir versus @JetBlue in Customer Service?Who will win!For Me @AmericanAir is a convenience to a trip to Cali &lt;3
@AmericanAir lost 3 pieces of our bags, haven't delivered them in 36 hours, lied that they were delivered, and still no refund.  Never again
@JetBlue Is that a guarantee? We'll see about that tomorrow morning when I have to fight for a seat.
@SouthwestAir Just go ahead and start the scavenger hunt after 5 pm today when work is over ;) #DestinationDragons
@united I got an email saying "changes to my MileagePlus account are confirmed" but I didn't make any changes. Help?
@JetBlue also. Emergency exit seats. 6'2" and that's a huge win.
@united at MSP w/3 employees trying to check in several hundred and the line is crazy might miss our plane be sure to thank these employees
@VirginAmerica Will flights be leaving Dallas for LA on February 24th?
@united I'm rebooked. Getting home 4 hours Late Flightr then planned. What are the chances I'll ever see my bag again? #unhappytraveler
@VirginAmerica I can't check in or add a bag. Your website isn't working. I've tried both desktop and mobile http://t.co/AvyqdMpi1Y
@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight due to "weather" when others are flying out just fine.  No compensation, no resolution.  Incompetent.
@usairways 3rd time cut off after 10+ minutes on hold with Chairmans desk?!??? Wth how are we supposed to rebook Cancelled Flightled flights?!?!?
.@united Your airline is again rated the WORST in America so you've got your work cut out for you. It's bc you treat customers like garbage.
@USAirways Going to Manchester, UK now i'm going to miss a wedding. You going to rebook that too? Why have you chosen to Cancelled Flight my flight??
@SouthwestAir can you provide direct assistance? My colleague and I cannot re-book b/c the ticket was booked via a corporate account. #help
@united his cell phone record needs to be checked to see who did conversed with. I trust the FAA can handle this better.
@SouthwestAir @CBSsoxfan you get to hold? called twice only to be kicked off.calls 3-6 #phonedied #AListpreferred http://t.co/1TZZ0vbMbS
@USAirways thank you.3860 to cincy.just landed.you should add frequent flyer miles to my account..  a long, incredibly frustrating day
@united thank you! Love united!! Have 4 flights today!
@USAirways on plane from BOS to CLT for 60 mins. Still at gate. Crew says system-wide computers preventing paperwork. Any info you can give?
@usairways I just learned that although there is travel policy and they waive the change fee-you will still be charged a $25 reservation fee
@USAirways I have never had a more unpleasant travel experience in my life. Now I might not get on my flight till tomorrow? This is insane
@AmericanAir better do the right thing and take care of @Cowboycerrone or els you're losing business!!!!
@AmericanAir Has AA Flight 296 from San Antonio to Dallas been Cancelled Flighted?
@united can I just go ahead and live in your premium cabins? I'm in heaven now en route to LHR
@AmericanAir please message me for assistance - can't get through to anyone.
@USAirways There isn't a ticket number...the transaction is still pending.
@USAirways flight 413 my carryon is missing.stollen off plane or left at gate. Worst customer service. Doesn't seem to be anyone's concern.
@united quality work going on here. http://t.co/9xbO5daKaK
@JetBlue why is my flight delayed 2.5 hours. This is insane. Every other flight has made it to NYC.
@AmericanAir @united week is going to make up for anything, or put me at ease.  You should be asking me how you can fix things, how to...
@united @PGATOUR @NTrustOpen I read that last hashtag as Go F United. Makes sense since they F us by Cancelled Flightling ticketed reservations
@JetBlue Token $75.00 Goodwill Voucher for passengers stuck on flight 136 from Phoenix today. 3 hour mark. How about a $27,000 per passenger
@united I would understand if weather was the issue, but bc of airline maintenance I had to sleep on an airport floor and lose an entire day
@SouthwestAir AhahüòÉüíïüéµ That is whyI love SW‚úà‚ùó(^^)‚ù§
@SouthwestAir Great, thank you. Best of luck dealing with this horrible winter.
@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my wife's flight and she has to call but your service won't even let us. Going on 7 hours now.
@SouthwestAir when you enter every contest for #DestinationDragons and lose :(
@AmericanAir "Thank you for contacting American. The email address you have written to is an unmonitored account‚Äù
@SouthwestAir why are you the ONLY airline that is not flying out of BNA today?
@JetBlue flight delayed at JFK 2 hours, then 3 hours, then 8.5 hours? Now it's back to 5 hours with no explanation or apology?
@AmericanAir It is now going to be reported to the police due to the sexual assult sad that you didn't care
@USAirways delayed, connection missed, now extended layover how about a lounge pass for PHL. #5077
@SouthwestAir As a frequent traveler, I've never been treated so coldly &amp; had an airline offer nothing when my flight was Cancelled Flightled. #nolove
@JetBlue Dumps Amex - Nassau News Live http://t.co/DZg99JFIiK
@AmericanAir wish you had a better mobile app.  You should look at the app from @united as it is much more seemless to check in
@AmericanAir Hi, I have my name, email, and AAdvantage #, but website won't let me reset password. Can we troubleshoot together? Thanks!
@united Aw, thanks for the kind words. Totally makes these extra 6 hours sitting in an airport SOOOO much better.
@USAirways $75 for that uncertainty? I know u run an account; u don't create policy. But it's an undue penalty for a job req'ing flexibility
@USAirways Paid for a Choice Seat my Choice is to NOT have big man next to me in my seat, too. #oldseatnocushion #worstflight #nohelponboard
@JetBlue ah no the staff was perfect this morning at JFK, more sleep for me!! :)
@SouthwestAir I understand weather is not your fault, but as a frequent flyer I expected better customer service. I'll be trying @Delta
@united my dad booked through orbitz and due to weather he can't make it to the airport. Can you help him?
@united it was UA381 on 14 Feb. Point is, overselling flights= bad. Making people wait 1hr while you kick them off after boarding is worse
Please explain ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/vOsIzh17sl‚Äù
@united boarding was decent, 3 useless agents that don't speak English (after 2.5hrs of hold) 6hrs of mech delay not so much
@united and that it would be sent on the next flight to Hayden/steamboat (HDN) from Denver. So I'm hoping its on there
@JetBlue which type plane is flt 1065 from bos to rsw?
@virginAmerica Other carriers are less than half price for a round trip fare. I am stunned. http://t.co/UKdjjijroW
@united  @MrAndyEp like 2 weeks after my flight!?!? Creative!
@AmericanAir thank you!
@USAirways Hold time to book award travel from Gold status: 4 HOURS and counting!!!! + 4 days of calling #usairwaysfail @AmericanAir
@USAirways  how does one downgrade a flight?
Cool! "@JetBlue: @hgeronemus We are 60% there and anticipate completing installation on all our A320's this year. http://t.co/sGckBopATA‚Äù
@united Can't leave the Tarmac ..united's gate agent cannot agree on a head count. 20 min now counting a 100 people max #epicfailunited
@united the wifi in the ewr lounge reminds me of the old days of dial up
@united so we fly into SFO and Honululu gets pushed back 3.5 hours and now it looks like more delays.  I beg of you plz sort this out soon!
@JetBlue Pooling and gifting are completely different.  I shouldn't have to be charged $375 to send points.  Its disgusting.
@united You please do not burn my dreams !!!  #burningman tickets sales today.
@USAirways Easily the most ridiculous experience trying to spend money with your company.
@united Thanks Yup I'm all set.  It happens.   SLC ground staff were prompt,  helpful and courteous.
@SouthwestAir My first call got dropped. Waited 15 mins for the second but ran out of time. Will try again Late Flightr. No way to do this online?
@AmericanAir you called back just to put me on hold. It's midnight. Literally just want to know how I'm getting home and I'm getting no help
@USAirways My last flight was Cancelled Flightled and I'm very disappointed.
@JetBlue thank you. Appreciate that!!
@USAirways when I told csr I would close acct, he couldn't care less
@SouthwestAir on hold for 15+ min...no estimated answer time. Any help here?
@USAirways it would be nice to just pull up to the gate. Still sitting here
@SouthwestAir I need to reschedule a flight and I've been on hold for almost an hour. This is ridiculous. Is there a best number to call?
@AmericanAir btr trained gate agts. Im a frequent flyer &amp; have nvr had issue w/my bag 2day I was forced 2 gate check while priority boarding
@united can you get a gate for UA4727?  Turrible.
@AmericanAir 4828 but I just missed it because no one is at the gate to marshall us in so now I have to rent a car &amp; drive 5 hrs. So thanks.
@united Not a happy flyer.  UA flight 1161 from SFO to Cleveland.  Sunday 2/22.  Stay tuned for blog article from http://t.co/VdFdODqVGx
@united -How is it that all my flight times were changed without any official notification? Almost missed my flight this morning. Not cool!
@JetBlue Thank you for the service credit. And to @PamGrout for positive thoughts.
@USAirways been on hold 2 hours for a Cancelled Flighted flight. I understand the delay. I don't understand you auto-reFlight Booking Problems me on TUESDAY. HELP!
@JetBlue lol the fleet on fleek... i see yall ballin... new jets on deck..
@USAirways this is the aforementioned pilot. @AmericanAir sure you want to merge with these patron hitting hoodlums? http://t.co/C24cEfa9pl
@USAirways Can you help with a seat assignment?  5 people flight 694, PHX to HNL, seats are split up.  Anything you can do will be great.
@united did not let me get on the IAH-HNL direct. Now weather delay for my SFO leg. Stop being reactive and be proactive!
@SouthwestAir okay I understand a delay one way. But both ways? C'mon #annoyed #flights
@SouthwestAir I absolutely will. Where can I send it?
@united Why have airlines always told us they can't open a cabin door once it has been closed?  This plane has done it 3 times tonight.
@SouthwestAir yes please.my son lives in NJ.
@USAirways pilot says that we are going to take off in 10 minutes. So maybe the systems came back online?
@SouthwestAir I just wanna say you're incredible for sending people to see their idols. Sooooo kind and amazingüíñ #DestinationDragons
@JetBlue's CEO battles to appease passengers and Wall Street - Waterbury Republican American http://t.co/D1eRGPdWsJ
@SouthwestAir has become like every other airline #crooked I can't believe they are taking over $500 #shouldwearmasks #shocked
@JetBlue - worst view for an athlete; watching your team from the front seat of the chase van #nogearnotraining
@JetBlue What about if I booked it through Orbitz? My email is correct, but there's a middle party.
@JetBlue why did you just Cancelled Flight flight 670 last minute?!?
@USAirways has the most ass backwards process for using credits on flights. even trying to get a hold of customer relations is impossible
Nice try @AmericanAir I heard your crew whisper "she's still at the hotel, she probably doesn't think she has to work until tomorrow"
@AmericanAir delayed on the way to Puerto Rico and delayed on the way back to New York, this is disgraceful
@United has two whole people trying to schedule a flight's worth of missed connections. Shameful http://t.co/6kqLhVaP7G
@SouthwestAir is there a way to DM you?
@united and what am I suppose to do with that number?
@AmericanAir The word failure means: an act or instance of failing or proving unsuccessful; lack of success nonperformance of something due.
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/8o3SCR5EFW‚Äù smh yall expect me to trust a childish airline with my life? #Nah
@Sb5551 Sounds like  @USAirways should have planned better since this weather was no surprise. Completely unacceptable wait times!!!
@AmericanAir I filled out that whole form before receiving a poor poor response. Is there no direct email address in reply?
@united awesome. Thx. And thx for replying so damn fast, sure as hell beats 80s cheeze hold music!!
@SouthwestAir yall have me sleeping in the airport until 4pm tomorrow! thanks
@SouthwestAir could you add me to that list? Been on hold for an hour 15
@AmericanAir - yep , they've been good.  Now can you make that 1535 flight to mci wait just a tick....üòÉ
@AmericanAir btw you guys should consider making a lounge at Austin Intl. airport! Very popuLate Flightd area! Will help the company for sureüëå
@USAirways Uh yeah. Flight boarded &amp; now 1 hr Late Flightr we still sit. Update on 4435 to DCA?
@united thanks, it was my first time in a United lounge and felt welcomed.
@united was never given one
@AmericanAir - you broke my sick wife's luggage handle going from JFK to LAX...she had to drag her bag thru the airport! #customerservice
@USAirways Can you guys please give an update?  Been sitting on Tarmac on flight 601 yet the website still says it's on time?
@SouthwestAir Finally got me home #BNASnow
@united poor old United: never seem to get the response right :)
@AmericanAir That‚Äôs a rather clunky process. Whoever designed that clearly doesn‚Äôt understand e-mail 101.
@SouthwestAir Hi Guys good morning how are you doing
@united Name correct on original confirmation but spelled wrong on check-in reminder. First name and MI run together. Cause for concern?
@JetBlue thank you!!
@SouthwestAir Thanks for sending my kid to the #DestinationDragons concert Vegas @Imaginedragons So awesome! http://t.co/G9b6e0a2sZ
@JetBlue here we go again, 2nd round trip to CA in a week #TrueBlue
@united is the worst airline in the world.
@JetBlue - BlueManity brought tears to my eyes. JetBlue' s commitment to giving back to the crewmembers and the community is aww inspiring!
@JetBlue @shannonwoodward I'll be checking often. Most probably when they hand the oscars out to the nerds, geeks and badly dressed.
@JetBlue no one yet but some, fl 8162
@JetBlue already spent $300 to stay at hotel last night due to you guys rescheduling my flight. Since my Cancelled Flightation I've spent almost $500
@AmericanAir Eventually the call got through. Not sure what changed. Thank you a lot though!
@SouthwestAir I would die if I got tickets to #DestinationDragons and you would be invited to my funeral
@AmericanAir Such a suprise! New vanity kit set for frequent travellers üòÄ thank you AA! http://t.co/fA7Nygn1Ux
@JetBlue thanks so much for help Us, u r amazing!
@JetBlue thanks!
@USAirways would it kill you to give me 30-60 seconds of bad muzak instead of constant commercials while on hold?
Is it insulting that @USAirways @AmericanAir offer a "non required $50 voucher as a goodwill offering..At least my bag can fly round trip
@SouthwestAir  Just picked up my bag at SEATAC all the clothes are soaking wet... #bagawim http://t.co/nGxAl9OmL6
@VirginAmerica it was a disappointing experience which will be shared with every business traveler I meet. #neverflyvirgin
@united How can I verify if wheelchair assistance has been requested for my next flight?
@AmericanAir Awesome customer service on #390 from rdu. They snuck my wife a warm cookie. Thx!
FYI, @JetBlue: The last email response - "we undrstnd this wasnt best 4 you" -but hope 2 wlcm u back onbrd N the future...   nice touch. lol
@AmericanAir  it's not cool that my flight was Cancelled Flightled after sitting on the plane for over an hour. üëéüò°‚úàÔ∏è #notahappycustomer #leavingtomm
Bruh...real tweet from @JetBlue "Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/dqny4aKTg9"
@SouthwestAir is my favorite airlines. I've never had issues with them. Plus there crew is entertaining.
@SouthwestAir I love and appreciate the fact that you guys rarely Cancelled Flight flights and are on time, but I need a Cancelled Flightlation this time. üôè
@USAirways What's the point of a baggage claim ticket if they don't scan it  for tracking?
@eatgregeat WOW~Thx for thinking of us, Greg! Heard #SOBEWFF was amazing! We've heard the same about @JetBlue (ps thx for the info) #TeamNKH
@USAirways my phone has been on hold since midght  fkn 7 hrs of hold ?? Unacceptable!!!!!!!!
@usairways I get extended hold times due to the weather...but 2-1/2 hours on hold (and counting). HELP!!
@SouthwestAir I'm in line at the airport right now. Will you cover hotel fair or am I to sleep in the airport?
@AmericanAir gate agents disappeared and customer service agents were miserable and unhelpful. #letdown #neveragain
@JetBlue so happy you can accommodate peanut/treenut allergies on flight! 1st online cover from air provider
@JetBlue aka take stuff out of the checked bag! Then just carry on the extra weight. For someone just had shoulder surgery that's just no
JetBlue reading the NYTimes. ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/lvIrTDtqly‚Äù
@united employee=faceless. Don't throw them under the bus. Starts with management. I'm almost a million miler and own my own company. 1/2
@USAirways thank you for leaving my 74 y/o grandma stranded because connecting flt could not wait 10 minutes. I will never fly you again
@AmericanAir i will be writing a very detailed letter to you all about this experience today. I have never experienced such awful cs ever
@united right as we think we will take off, we stop to get de-iced. Why wasn't this done when the planes were sitting out all night?
@AmericanAir really appreciate the great customer service... One of your service agents just hung up on me when asking legitimate questions
@AmericanAir the fact that that rule makes it poor customer service. I can Cancelled Flight/change on @SouthwestAir with no penalty or hoops.
@JetBlue I would go for 3rd time to Jamaica to volunteer w/ at risk youth #flyitforward #dc #stpatricksfoundation #rotary
@USAirways still on hold...1 hr 27 mins....thank god for chairman status. status match @Delta?
@JetBlue I guess I have to redo the Flight Booking Problems. Ugh!
@AmericanAir I understand. I'm feeling cranky. I called AA's bag tracker number and heard "your bag has not been located." üò©
@VirginAmerica Plans to Include Austin to its Dallas Route - TopNews Arab #Emirates http://t.co/aqZWecOkk2
@JetBlue Thanks for the FB. message telling me I will have to wait between 1-3 days.  I'm waiting.
@AmericanAir stuck on the tarmac in CLT because the our gate is not open. Hope I don't miss my connection.... #logistics #AmericanView
@USAirways Will tweet all day until I get a live cust rep. I will make sure the world knows you don't care about your customers health.
@united it won't help...been there done that.
.@JetBlue i'm sorry.  Boarding chaos is underway.  Please query again post scrum.
@JetBlue well but for now the only thng we can do is wait for someone to explain us the situation with responsibility http://t.co/ML1JaCpmch
@AmericanAir thanks keep me updated just hope I make either of my connections to Killeen Tx
@JetBlue if someone had bothered to inform us that the airport closed, that would have helped.
@JetBlue exactly why is my flight delayed? 599 BDL to DCA? Can't seem to get an answer
@united false.
@JetBlue hard to tell, but was told wifi only worked for one side of the plane.
@united no worries, I think it‚Äôs under control. (the emails are keeping me informed)
@JetBlue its always a pleasure ‚ò∫Ô∏è
@USAirways Are you not even going to acknowledge that you bumped me from a flight (NOT BECAUSE OF WEATHER I AM IN ARIZONA)
@JetBlue yes, We have de baggage claim, I'm so sad for the baggage and how They treat Us üòû please we need That baggage
@united left my iPad on MCO-&gt;IAD flight 174. How long to hear back once claim submitted? TY!
@USAirways Ever sit on hold and just lose track of time? http://t.co/Yqhk8LJaBN
@SouthwestAir @taylormdowns We share that value in common. :)
@JetBlue and The from @WSJ Team to Offer In-#Flight Access to Journal ... - Digital Journal http://t.co/2Nzh3QOaZo
@united that's why I missed my flight. If the flight had been held for 5 minutes I would have made it. I watched it pull away from the gate
@JetBlue any idea when the flight will actually take off?
@JetBlue quick question, to pay for a second bag, do I have to do it online or can I do it at the airport?
@united considering I'm now stuck in Newark with virtually sleep in 30+ hours, I doubt it :/ hope car rentals are available
@JetBlue just a very rude rep while trying to book family vacation using trvl credit. on phone w/ new rep now who is being very helpful
@USAirways Can you advise on what's happening with departure delays from CLT?
@USAirways this is no way to treat women.  I want someone to contact me and explain how they will make this acceptable.
@SouthwestAir after an hour and a half then it came back damaged. Not happy üò£
@united so funny that my boarding pass said PRIORITY a because clearly I am not a priority to this airline
@united - I think she was having a rough moment w/ a bad passenger from an earlier flight. Things got considerably better. Thanks!
@JetBlue I put it my "to" and "from" airports, click update and it tells me to put in my "to" and "from" airports.
@USAirways you have most likely lost my business. Terrible experience! Too many times stuck on Tarmac and last min Cancelled Flightled flights. #Done
@united lost my bags and there was a flight from Chi to Eri that landed over 1.5 hrs ago...yet still have zero updates?? #UnitedAirlinesSux
@SouthwestAir last week I flew from DAL to LAX. You got us in almost an hour early. Thank You.
@SouthwestAir even with the 50$ voucher for picking up my bag
@United Your customer service for Mileage Plus customers is a disgrace. I just spent 45 min on the phone to reset a pin number, with no luck
@united 45+ min at EWR baggage claim #stillnobags #ridiculous
@AmericanAir Phone just disconnects if you stay on the line. Need to checkout of hotel in 2 hrs &amp; have no place to go. Can't keep calling.
@JetBlue this is ridiculous we are on 1.5 hours coming up of waiting to deplane, there are are newborns on board
@USAirways Looks like I'm already delayed and will miss my connecting flight in Philadelphia. Do you un-delay your flights?
@AmericanAir refund
@USAirways I don't think I've ever had a us airways flight that went smoothly.
@AmericanAir hook me up with a free trip to Barbados and I will tell you the secret beaches to see
@united my flight was at 1 pm. Still at the airport gee what service.  Do they care, nope.  Delayed until 7:55.
@united No. The entire problem here is that I was never sent anything via email and only given a Flight Booking Problems number over the phone.
@USAirways your customer service stinks. Trying to book a flight for hours now and keep getting hung up on. #usairwayssucks
@AmericanAir My flight 1108 was Cancelled Flightled. I need to be rebooked, and I can't do it online and they aren't answering calls. Help!
@AmericanAir highly disappointed in the baggage service with this merge with @USAirways you guys have lost our 1st bag and now missing items
@USAirways I guess they only respond to compliments. Sorry, can't think@of even ONE.
@USAirways and despite tailwind‚Ä¶ Will still be Late Flight.
@JetBlue can we get a honest update on departure of flite 454. Been on plane with infant children
@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flightled my flight and I'm stranded in St. Louis. Not sure what to do. No other flight until tomorrow. Am I to sleep in airpt
@AmericanAir I'm trying to choose my seats but every time I go to the next flight I get system error
@united literally sucks
@JetBlue yes, last month when Boston got the first big snow storm and my flight was Cancelled Flightled.
@USairways E190 lands without nose gear in Houston - @Flightglobal http://t.co/Yf9NhMwyFF
Why doesn't @AmericanAir provide a means for dialogue?  What is the fear that drives this decision?  #worstcustomerserviceever
@USAirways @AmericanAir just be prepared for a claim if that bag is lost ... Too many valuables to carry in my hands. #us2146 to #aa2924
@united thank you for letting me down.My luggage is still in Denver but I'm in Phl. #neveragain #flyingwithUS #disappointed #lostacustomer
@united you guys have such big hearts.. keep up the good work

@united my reservation were changed so that I can longer make my connecting flight. How can I change this without incurring a fee?
@USAirways : You Make the Reservation; We'll Make the Excuses! #usairwaysfail
@united thank you for the help!!
@JetBlue wouldn't mind paying for the snacks but no $ for tix :-) Great job guys!
@AmericanAir they could be seen if your horrible customer service group would actually update the information! Never fly American again!
@united This has been the WORST flight experience I've ever had. Thank you for ending my vacation on such a bad note.
@united - any way to get a message to an international flight gate at EWR?      Road conditions are horrible trying to get to flight ...
@JetBlue sent
@VirginAmerica Very poor experience. First computer problem now seat malfunction. Stuck. Missing meeting in San Diego.
@JetBlue sadly, no! I have the app, but it also is experiencing difficulties. The flight information boards are keeping me updated.
@united any chance you'll ever do CPUs on your JFK-LAX like @AmericanAir?
@united I'm trying your WiFi on UA1616. But sorry it really slow. Even #Spotify lagging and that isn't a hard stream.
@SouthwestAir I have used you guys for most my travels, but this last experience I will never use southwest again! #worstcustomerservice
@VirginAmerica Your planes are really pretty. Just thought u should know that. :)
@AmericanAir research buddy. Read my previous tweets and get some context.
@AmericanAir I've been trying to change frm AA 2401 to LAX at 6:50am MONDAY morning then AA 2586 from LAX to FAT to flight AA 1359?#helpAA

@JetBlue how much longer to JFK open's I am a diabetic and I need sugar plane don't have nothing
@united how come it's cheaper to fly to BKK than NRT even though to get to BKK you take an extra flight, from NRT!
@united is by far the worst airline ever üò°üò°

@SouthwestAir need to Cancelled Flight a few more can you please check DM
@USAirways please change direct flights from RIC to JFK instead of LGA. Pleeeeease! LGA is the pits.
@united no they aren't - I just called to check. #WORSTCUSTOMERSERVICE
@VirginAmerica seriously would pay $30 a flight for seats that didn't have this playing.it's really the only bad thing about flying VA
@United had a maintenance issue. Stuck in Geneva with meal voucher that won't even cover a pLate Flight of spaghetti. Really.
@VirginAmerica I mean. Probably inappropriate while on board.. But, it's on!
@VirginAmerica congrats, you just got all my business from EWR to SFO/LAX. Fuck you @united fl1289 SFO/EWR was the clincher...
@SouthwestAir retiring with my hubby and it's our 25th wedding anniversary this year! Companion pass please!!
@united now sitting on the tarmac for a half hour after landing because your jetway is broken. #2daysofunitedfailures #1thingafteranother
@united I suppose your customers enjoy screaming toddlers then. Not my problem if someone complains!
@USAirways you're right it's not fun. Especially when I don't have much of a choice. Lol. #curvygirltravels
@JetBlue lots of people scratching heads and looking at screens ignoring passengers
@SouthwestAir please refund my ticket. What a terrible experience. #southwestfail
@united KN: not allowing me to bypass the receipt # on the refund request form. Never received receipt email. charged http://t.co/Cju102xP2k
@USAirways any word on flight 1748 getting out of DFW in the near future? Stuck on plane at gate for over an hour
@USAirways You are 0 for 3 so far in on-time flights on this vacation.
@JetBlue Seems very likely.
@united Why don't you respond to my e-mails of facebook msg?! I'm still wating for my tickets!! I'm getting really angry and disappointed!
@USAirways 1 1/2 hours on hold to customer service without anyone answering is more than ridiculous!
@USAirways in line for 90 min after mechanical issues caused me to miss my flight. 1 rep for 20 upset people. http://t.co/XFWXsRwkHa
@USAirways I need to speak with a customer service agent today between 5-8pm  I had an unfortunate incident of discrimination today.
@AmericanAir Please follow me.
@JetBlue DONT LOSE MY LUGGAGE!!!
@USAirways please thank Mellie at CAE, Tammy in baggage claim at CLT 4 #excellent customer service 2day, BUT I have a complaint.
@USAirways Yes, ground crew finally showed up so plane could depart very Late Flight.

@virginamerica spruce moose!
@AmericanAir the one at 11:30am? My app still shows it as on time!
@united I would appreciate a response regarding the pressurization failure on flight 1109. You seem to be responding to less serious issues
@united Is it possible to redeem miles for one part of a round trip itinerary without having to book two separate reservations?
@USAirways oh great after a 5 hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving.  Flight 1137 has been awful
@USAirways reservations had me on hold for 2 hours only to hang up...smh üòï
@USAirways @AmericanAir "ma'am the doors close 10 mins prior to departure" "but I was here 20 mins before?!?" laughter from the 2 agents
@united how we looking on getting those bags to Lusaka
@united Hmmm...seems like this could be something to be changed to be more #flyerfriendly.
@united has terrible customer service &amp; doesn't feel the need to notify its customers when their flights are delayed
@United WiFi onboard 737-800 far superior in pricing and performance (user-perceived bandwidth and Late Flightncy) to recent @GoGo experiences.
@JetBlue we saw one, he was as useless as the tsa agents who inspected my shoes
@USAIRWAYS ARE YOU KIDDING ME?? Bad customer service, folks. Flew from PSP to PHX flight 2692 on 2/19. (cont) http://t.co/KigfKVXxDQ
@SouthwestAir Gate agent gave me wrong departure info and caused me to miss my flight and now I am on stand by! #NotHappy
@JetBlue can you share where it is coming from?
@SouthwestAir thanks! Very excited to see it :D
@AmericanAir are you kidding me?  No one answering calls on reserv line due to high call volume and not even an option to wait.  Brutal
@united AND my luggage has been broken!! #youcouldntmakethis up #brokenwheel

@USAirways can you please have your employee that has been called 5 times by the flight crew finish maintenance on US 734 so we can depart!
@SouthwestAir 3 flights Cancelled Flightled today. Now we have been on hold for over an hour!
@VirginAmerica are you ready!? Let's say it together.. 'Noooo turbulence today!' üòò
@AmericanAir no I will be calling corporate!
@AmericanAir why have I been on hold for almost 3 hours? This is ridiculous
@JetBlue kids fly. Don't hire people who don't care about them. This guy. #jetblue http://t.co/clvlhfgUZw
@SouthwestAir I will be writing in about the service via email. My company also transports well over 100 clients monthly via SW.
@USAirways had a horrible experience flying from Montego Bay to Philadelphia on 2/11. $125 2check a golf bag, constant selling in-flight
@SouthwestAir 2 hrs to put a tag on my bag sayin it should go to greenville instead of Raleigh?! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!
@SouthwestAir the flight isn't that empty.... Is this rude or not? http://t.co/4RL0p5JChB
@JetBlue continuing you record of never having a flight leave on time. Add up how much time with with my family you have cost me. #jetblue
@SouthwestAir I'm sorry for straying and going with @AmericanAir I've learned my lesson. These attendants need some SW happiness!
@VirginAmerica Because we never rec'd Cancelled Flightlation notice we were left w no options to fly out of PS. Driving to LA for a red eye Mon w kids
@USAirways why aren't twitter and reservations connected? What do people want? Reservations, duh?!?!
@JetBlue U said 15mins to Take Off and now we were told 1hr more delay &amp; possible Cancelled Flightlation. How do U plan to rectify this? #Frustrated
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/yZH4ZRQM0i‚Äù really JetBlue? #fleek?!!! üòÇüòÇüòÇ hell no... Yall petty
@JetBlue he just went above and beyond to be helpful
@united I have requested upgrade for EWR BOM flight, end of May. Miles + copay. When will i know if I am upgraded?
@JetBlue ok. I'll book JB to JFK then book to ATH. Thank you.
@SouthwestAir @love_dragonss AHHHH YES LAUREN
@AmericanAir no not yet. Waiting to be connected to an agent
@JetBlue Boston gate C12
@united Well I can tell you that your customer service at RDU airport is horrific but is exception at O'Hare in Chicago.
@united what incentive do I have to give you another chance?
@JetBlue loves to respond to positive tweets but they ignore problems w/ customers. Just ask NOLA musician @j_beatz247 about that. #shameful
@JetBlue I would love to Fort Lauderdale now that would cool.
@USAirways after a crappy flight due to delays and rude staff members I'm happy to report after paying $25 to check my luggage it's ruined
@USAirways wow.. Flight Cancelled Flightled, slept on the floor at the airport and now flight delayed
@USAirways That's not the question. Question is: how do I get past the computer fastest if we both know that the computer can't help me?
@AmericanAir will do. I'd think, though, that a literally identical itinerary to your sample itineraries would work - maybe need to update?
@usairways is your clt departures delayed? Hoping I can make my connection after a lengthy take off delay and endless taxi-ing here at clt
@SouthwestAir shhhh i don't want something else to steal our dealüòâ
@AmericanAir can you help me update a birthday that was incorrectly input in a reservation? This is preventing me from checking in
@USAirways - Check-in staff at PHX are awesome! Great traffic control for general boarding.
@united @luke_mcintosh68 nah you wouldn't
@SouthwestAir I need your help but no one will pick up the phone.
‚Äú@USAirways: @hegshmeg O‚Äù thank you for that elaborate response
@AmericanAir Hi, can you please ticket my award ticket? The status is "On Request" now. Thanks.
@usairways  US1799 CLT-&gt;SFO in first no desert, no snack basket. Incoming was on time ? What‚Äôs up?
@united DM sent
@AmericanAir, I've tried no less than 8 times today to get in touch with your service desk beginning at 8:30 EST.  I'm having no luck -help!
@AmericanAir does that mean my ktn is not in my reservation?
@USAirways thanks. We did see an agent. Unhelpful. Some got vouchers others did not for unexplained reasons.
@USAirways i will be on this plane while on the ground longer than i will be in the air. US5235
@USAirways Aye, and nothing to do with an automated system which doesn't work properly. Anyway, got through to somebody...
@united Both flights went great and improved my view of your airline, cheers! Flight attendents on UA1022 deserve a raise
@AmericanAir thanks
@SouthwestAir and YOUR costumer service representative lied to me and ensured me the plane would be leaving by 330.. It's scheduled for 455
@JetBlue trivia contest to win flight. 1 question. RT and Follow &amp; I'll send you answer to enter. http://t.co/AucSYKFUHD via @WSJPlus

@SouthwestAir I tried for 5hrs to contact SW! Twitter, fb, phone, email w/ no reply. 24hrs Late Flightr u respond, what could you do at this point?
Bingo! ‚Äú@SouthwestAir: Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We'll be happy to reach out to Noah so we can make this right. ^MR‚Äù
@AmericanAir at the gate when I get off the plane?
@united, fuck you and your closed premier access lines at ORD. Probably gonna miss my flight...Start treating your customers better.
@united I'm searching for flights to redeem with miles and getting different search results with 2 user accounts. Any reason why?
@USAirways can you get me home to Syracuse? After 6 Cancelled Flightled flights, one re routing three of us are sitting in Charlotte

@AmericanAir I am looking for help on USAirways award travel booked for wife and two boys, no seats assigned.
@AmericanAir Ok. We will probably Cancelled Flight our flights then, take a refund, and get home another way. Wednesday won't work for us.
@united I am flying from msp to dxb, my child will turn 2 during the trip do I have to buy a return ticket for my child?
@VirginAmerica is anyone doing anything there today?  Website is useless and no one is answering the phone.
@united the drunk guy you threw out of flight UA936 4hrs ago is better off than the rest of us held up for 5hrs in the plane without food.
@JetBlue my request has nothing to do with rescheduling. But customer service has such a bad attitude today. #badservice
@united Hubby made it by the skin of his teeth!   :)
@AmericanAir no repair made to the water line. No potable water on board this flight. "We will take off soon." Time for new planes MCI&gt;DFW.
@USAirways I've been on hold with your Divident Miles service desk for 45 minutes, and that's after being hung up on the first time.
@USAirways this is how concerned your gate attendants at C26 are this afternoon. #nocommunication #nocrew http://t.co/hFjYN2vtVj
@united I have proof that my situation now is due to company mistake
@SouthwestAir I'm miserable on your Orlando to Vegas nonstop right now. How big must a guest be for u to require 2 seats?  I'm in 1A btw.
@JetBlue Airways Stock Rating Lowered by Vetr Inc. (JBLU) - Dakota Financial News http://t.co/QW2eBEEMVg
@SouthwestAir Hoping you answer the phone today?
@united I'm Cancelled Flighting my #mileageplus card and I will NEVER do business with you again. You clearly don't care about your customers.
@united I requested an online refund option they denied saying the ticket was used, hope they understand the problem from your approach
@united are you looking for European Flight attendants for Paris or Frankfurt?Best, Fabrice
@JetBlue but you guys should know that musicians are very sensitive about the safety of their instruments when flying. For good reason.
@USAirways should look into better service‚úåÔ∏è
@usairways I've been on hold for approaching 2 hrs for an issue when I changed my ticket online. Frustrating.
@JetBlue is yr site having trouble for mobile check in ?
@JetBlue get me home! Flight 2016 from buf to Bos is missing a captain!? Really!?
@USAirways what is the expected wait time to speak to someone via 800 number?
@SouthwestAir do you think the flights out of Nashville will be Cancelled Flighted tomorrow?
@JetBlue you #fail. Snow coming to DC area. Tried to get on earlier flight. You refused. Now flight 6.5 hours delayed. Greedy and foolish.
@VirginAmerica is helping me step up my @Tinder game! #TinderTips #tinderchamp http://t.co/jBmVVha63A
@united pls stop sending texts every 15mins saying my flight is delayed another 15mins-It's been 3hrs. I usually defend u but this is lame..
@AmericanAir I am still waiting for that call back. Stranded and no one to talk to
@united UA1731 - Denver to Austin...  Still on the ground...
@united I'm try to upgrade my seats to first class but the wait time on the phone is 40 minutes... can you help?
@SouthwestAir took our BOS to BWI plane for a flight to StL and promised a replacement  1.5 hours Late Flightr. Now 2.5 hours delayed. Not happy.
@united received my bag. I appreciate taking care of the matter and following up!
@united Thank U for the 1hr delay then boarding us onto a plane that reeks of vomit, flight attendant indicated it wasn't cleaned properly.
@USAirways My family, friends and colleagues will NEVER  fly USAir again. Bad weather happens. The good airlines seem to communicate better.
@JetBlue okayyyy. But I had huge irons on way out. Promise no shenanigans?
@JetBlue where is our luggage?? Flight 424 has been waiting an hour for bags! #jetblue #poorservice
@USAirways 2 days in a row I call and still can't get anyone on the phone. Do you actually have any employees?
@united done
@JetBlue @TSA JetBlue never disappoints !
@united why do I check in online if I still have to wait in line for an hour to "check in" at counter? #fuckinlame  @naia_miaa
@JetBlue sitting on the plane in JFK waiting to take off doors are open catering is stocking up we are delayed but they couldn't be nicer
@united UA1534 has now had 11 different departure times. Wtf. Make up your mind.
@SouthwestAir Flight 3267 (N659SW) arrives at @FlyTPA following flight from @MitchellAirport http://t.co/LJ2YdKoR8q
@SouthwestAir could you tell me if any upgrades are available on a flight out of STL tomorrow morning.
@USAirways  last 2 times I checked a bags they were severally damaged.   No one answers the baggage call line for status?  #chairmanlove
@USAirways 2nd February in a row- stranded us when we try to return from Cancun! No contact info- no way to rebook! #badcustomerservice
@united I had one interview I was the last person what does that mean?
@JetBlue No worries. Time flew in the terminal and now we're taking off. Thanks again!
@SouthwestAir Kudos for adding #Passbook to your app! I LOVE IT!
@united where's my damn bag??
@JetBlue Tell me at what point will u realize u can't fly into DCA tonight- u Cancelled Flightled the 1pm when will u Cancelled Flight the 5:26
@united One of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes. Her tone &amp; language was very unprofessional.
@jetblue who's running your tweeter using the word fleek?
@USAirways i dont need to check status of my flight because i was ON the plane and you had a door malfunction. Get it together!!
@SouthwestAir had to let us off the plane bc the toilets done even work! There goes my family vacay to playa del Carmen, Mexico! #neveragain
@united which now has maintenance issues with an undetermined amount of time until the mechanics even arrive
@SouthwestAir  Southwest is currently awaiting government approval for this route. Do we know when it will be official?
@VirginAmerica Is there anything going on with the website? I've been getting a lot of errors past 30 minutes.
@SouthwestAir I gave you one more try. Figured you could get a 1 hr flight right. Nope. Delayed an hr. Seems to be every time.
@SouthwestAir that was supposed to say "boo" not book. booo.
@AmericanAir we're on AA1401 landed at 8:55pm in Miami, but waiting for a gate. Can someone on your team help us out?!
@JetBlue even @Citi responded quicker via Twitter when they #fail.... Still on hold, hoping no one books the flight..... @JetBlue #fail
@united Out of curiosity, when a flight is arranged, are pilots notified? There are a lot of "pilots haven't arrived yet" announcements.
@VirginAmerica that doesn't look to fat to me! It looks yummy!
@JetBlue whose performing at T5
@USAirways Changing my flights with no explanations and still don't have a confirmation. So disappointed in the service
@AmericanAir yes. Just sayin' that was a particularly poorly handled situation.
@AmericanAir My baggage is lost, my flight Cancelled Flightled and i get no accommodations? Not even to another airline. At least one free hotel?
@AmericanAir thanks for the recommendation. We've been sitting here for 45 minutes, last update was 35 min ago.
@SouthwestAir Yo, I'm trying to make a change to a reservation but whenever I select the flight it says, "Unable to price". Please help!
@USAirways has failed me all day long, should I blame it on @AmericanAir ?
@united stuck in YYZ because staff took a break? Not happy 1K....
@JetBlue before departure, while people who are delayed get up to $200 to compensate their time..
@JetBlue backlog is an hour at most, this is over two!  Unacceptable!!
@united can you DM me? Been on hold with customer service very long time (53 min +) and getting the run-around. Thanks.
@united United Club team is A+ &amp; got me a seat Late Flightr. Still, not sure why a last min UAL Cancelled Flightlation costs me $ yet overbooked folks get $?
@AmericanAir thanks for following up. I think it's fair to refund the ticket price and the two one way rental cars I had to buy.
@JetBlue CCNDJP/ I can send a screen shot of the systems error if an email address is provided
@virginamerica why don't any of the pairings include red wine?! Only white is offered :( #redwineisbetter
@united even after running to gate from your connecting flight, your customer service not let us in the plane that was just parked. Stranded
@southwestair #fattuesday Great job celebrating #mardigras today at Atlanta Airport. Another reason I'm nuts for you! http://t.co/8WBzOrRn3C

@JetBlue A month ago I had a flight booked but then had to Cancelled Flight it... I'm now Flight Booking Problems a separate flight for a different occasion.
@AmericanAir @superyan I did not get any compensation after Cancelled Flighting my departure TWICE and made me missed my own wedding.
Cool thx! Only a couple more #PGAShow flights til I'm #Mosaic...can't wait. Will be easier to change flights when weathers bad@JetBlue
@USAirways if you've got room on an earlier flight home, why charge me $75 to get on it? Be the hero!
@united How much is baggage check for International flights?
@united my flight was already Cancelled Flightled this morning because of a "snow storm in Denver". And now I'm in DC waiting for a pilot to get on+
@AmericanAir I've been on hold for 4 hrs, no call bk either. Family of 4 trying to get from HDN to DFW flight 1418 direct. Need new info plz
@united I can‚Äôt go back to the airport, I‚Äôm working, and won‚Äôt have time.  Are you telling me there is seriously no other way?
@JetBlue you want me to talk to the wall?
@united Apologize to the President. Once those employees blamed him, I heard it repeated 20 times.
@JetBlue thank you!
@JetBlue app just reminded me I will be flying to #FLL in 2 weeks. #ChillyCVZ #ThankGoodness @mypompanobeach #family #friends #sunshine
@JetBlue I guess you weren't able to do anything to improve the time.. and now it looks even Late Flightr.. going to be a #zombie tomorrow
@AmericanAir customer service (if you can call it that) refunded my money
@JetBlue Inconvenience is an understatement. More like torture. Clearly going down the wrong path, JetBlue.
@united missing this wedding because of these delays would not be cool
@JetBlue Flight 2202 out of JFK, 2 &amp; 1/2 hr delay. I could get over it if it was just  weather reLate Flightd, but considering it's not - Come on
@usairways told no gates open at #ORD, needed to wait 20mins. Still waiting after about 4 mins.
@united and to add to my earlier tweet. This was my daughters 5th Bday present. Thank you for the hard work and making it happen.
@united it was an international flight, and we didn't get our new eta until we were in the air.
@VirginAmerica I'm sure a lot of your 747 and 777 JFK-LHR flights go a lot faster than 513mph with a strong tailwind.
@united I have a LH return business ticket from Den to Fra.If I fly domestic with you,bag can be checked through to Fra,no need to claim?
@AmericanAir Here is the photo ;) http://t.co/VMqUURZUpW
@JetBlue  FLL to MDE, great flight, great customer service, THANKS! 2 mths waiting  @AmericanAir  to speak to a human at customer service
@AmericanAir I've been tryin to use my voucher to book a flight the last 2days. Lines are busy. Plse help me?The flight may go up.
@SouthwestAir luv my companion pass!
@VirginAmerica I applied for a position in @flyLAXairport ,and I was wondering if you guys received my application.
@united Okay thanks if you could please update me. I was told at the airport someone would call me today but they haven't.

@USAirways I really feel like your company needs evaluate their policies &amp; realize that transfers should be possible for tickets
@SouthwestAir All Flights lead to VEGAS BABY!
@AmericanAir  You can't get us to Cincy but our luggage will still go there tonight? Stranded us in Dallas for 2 days w/o clothes? #Yousuck
@USAirways Will do :)
@SouthwestAir Thank you!
@AmericanAir and @iTunesMusic have put me in bad mood. I haven't been this angry since Spagnuolo coached the #Rams
@SouthwestAir @challemann flying to LGA in the dead of winter? #jvstatus EWR &amp; JFK is always the intelligent option.
@USAirways Am I allowed to carry on a suit bag and carry on bag? My suit bag will hang like a jacket would. It is soft sided, 48"
@AmericanAir it's beyond complicated now and it feels like when I used to fly with United. Platinum means nothing.
@JetBlue btw, her name was Samantha and she won over everyone on the flight
@USAirways @AmericanAir so does that mean @AmericanAir that you might care about my sister be assaulted on one of your flights
@united Are your earnings so low that checkin people have to also be on Tarmac loading bags? JAN
@AmericanAir I've been trying to call to cxl a reservation for tomorrow, due to needing surgery this week - cannot get through?
@united I'm desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this Cancelled Flightled/delayed flight.  #unacceptable #ORD
@AmericanAir @DAI_President Good luck at DFW this evening AA!
@USAirways been sitting at gate for over 25 min on us 728! What gives???
@united united flight UA3774 after two delays just Cancelled Flightled no explanation &amp; no more flights to Norfolk that aren't booked. Renting a car.
@united I was abused , threatened and forced to travel in a lower cabine (last seat) in yesterday's flight from Houston to Sao Paulo
@united just sent you a message on Facebook, how do I follow up a complaint re. Missing clothing out of checked baggage?
@SouthwestAir no after 75 mins of hold, I finally hung up! Ridiculous wait times. Can you assist in Cancelled Flighting reservation?
@USAirways enormous lines at customer service and two agents what kind of service is that .. http://t.co/ffanixJhwh
@Usairways thanks for making miss connection, getting rebooked, missing that too, and a miserable day. Started my day @ 4:30am for nothing!
@SouthwestAir have to be honest, didn't expect a fast response, thank you!  Off to #Chiberia we go!
@USAirways I've been sitting in the Charlotte airport for 4 hours. Waited for crew and now maintenance.  #NeverAgain
@united Outbound 2 bags 70 lbs bags Returning home 1 bag 50 lbs. What is your logic? And WHY? Am I writing to a Machine? Human HELP required
@JetBlue No, it didn't all work out. I called Jet Blue from Mexico to address the fraud alert with Capital One on the line. Rebooked.
@SouthwestAir thank you. I was given this same reply 2 years ago. Can you direct me to an area I can learn more about the improvements?
#nothelpful MT @AmericanAir: Our call volume is extremely high today. Our apologies. Please continue contacting Reservations for assistance.
@SouthwestAir If a travel advisory is posted for DEN, can I then make changes to my ticket? Anything I need to know before I call?
@USAirways I've been trying for DAYS!  And I don't get hung up on until after I get through all the prompts.  What am I to do??
@AmericanAir Changed flight from BNA to 2/20 ahead of weather. Slammed me with cost diff because "no weather advisory."Really!
@SouthwestAir I am committed okay please hook me up for #DestinationDragons
@united I have submitted my complaint. I need to be compensated. How long will this take?
@united overbooked by FIFTY people?!? the worst.
@AmericanAir Thank you for being so responsive on Twitter. Truly impressive.
@united Bought a round trip to Chicago two days ago...today the same flight is half that! Is there any way for me to get that discount??
@JetBlue is bag check cut off 30 minutes before the original departure time or the estimated time shown online?
@AmericanAir - Appreciate your system is busy but when I call, having your automated system hang up on me is not helpful.
@USAirways Your "moveup" policy really sucks. United has a 24 hour policy for this with status. I was wanting to move up from 5am to 7am...
@JetBlue My card company and I explained the issue over the phone when I was in Mexico. I purchased a new ticket over the phone.
@Southwestair is this account even aware of the #destinationdragons contest? The one youre fucking up for me?
@USAirways will my known traveler no. transfer over from @AmericanAir ? when I check in at t-24 as an AA elite I can get choice seats?
@USAirways  Instead of fair treatment, I got a nasty letter from a lady in senior management that illness forfeits miles like death.
@SouthwestAir Thanks so much. Appreciate your kindness in adjusting our reservation. Even during snowstorms, I still prefer Southwest. üëç
@SouthwestAir yeehaw. You found us another plane.  Thx for listening to me vent.
@united YOU SUCK!
@AmericanAir I've never witnessed such covert tactics from an airline.
@AmericanAir although you have no control of the weather, you came through with a great customer service
@SouthwestAir Thank u Thank u Thank u for coming through for us! I sincerely didn't think it would happen. &lt;3 #SWA #THANKYOU
@SouthwestAir did you Cancelled Flight ALL flights into BNA today??? #needtogethome
@SouthwestAir  @TheEllenShow @Imaginedragons  @kdepetro313 .what a great first night. #DestinationDragons http://t.co/N3LrFo4UaY
@united @NTrustOpen can i go  #GolfUnited
@united I get that. But doing it by giving inaccurate/misleading info doesn't seem like a great way to do it. #hopethegearmakesitintact
@JetBlue That's right! :) Game, set, match.
@united just tried to log in and was told e-mail log in not currently available
@united You're trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant.
@United #767 taxing in at #ORD @fly2ohare @AirlineGeeks #avgeek http://t.co/uPocMmuLUN
@AmericanAir - We have; they were useless. Baggage service called before 9 to tell us we would have bags by 3. Now, maybe midnight.
@united I'm constantly having challenges with upgrades &amp; charges. In order to prevent DVT I have to pay an addtl $180 http://t.co/xC6jQ70r7B
@AmericanAir For the love of all that is holy, if your automated phone system is going to give like 8 options, give numerical shortcuts
@SouthwestAir neveind, it's been found and on its way. Thanks for making the process so painless
@USAirways Fabulous - thank you so much! Looking forward to taking to the skies with you! :)
@united well it IS John Hughes' birthday. But I will stick w the plane &amp; hold off on trains &amp; automobiles. Gate workers are doing well.
‚Äú@VirginAmerica: @KarinSLee Of course. Have fun celebrating!‚Äù Thanks! Happy Chinese New Year!

@JetBlue @zakkohane pretty sure he's saying Ricoh had great service down at BOS ;) #happytohelp
@USAirways call dropped &amp; no call back...another 45min-hour for another rep. The worst CS ever, online, by phone &amp; in person.
@united I already did.
@JetBlue i am here - what is your resolution?
@united so our flight into ORD was delayed because of Air Force One, but the last flight to SBN is at 8:20, 5 mins from now we just landed.
@AmericanAir most horrendous service ever !! On off two planes. Been in Phil for 10 hrs. Now captain can't get flight info to print? #wtf
@JetBlue Hawaii! Get me somewhere warm &amp; I can find some good to do. #FlyItForward
@USAirways they told me to call back Late Flightr
@AmericanAir tried ringing but told me to try again Late Flightr. I'm supposed to be leaving in an hour...
@JetBlue are there any food places open at the JFK T5 24//?
@AmericanAir - Please find my bag!! In Singapore for three days already without my bag. Last known destination LAX Tag: 580815 Please help.

@AmericanAir Hello...My baggage has been lost in another city. Can anyone help me with this?
@JetBlue what's the hold up with flight 1553? boarding should've taken place 30 minutes ago.
@SouthwestAir trying to get through to cust relations. Is there another # to use?
@united does forelock guarantee the fare only or fare &amp; seats?
@jetblue #philly lost and read program - Our customers get hot tea, great crewmembers, top notch info &amp; now #BOOKS! http://t.co/9rAGncw2Bk
@SouthwestAir are you guys alive? i've been on hold for 25 minutes and counting.....
@JetBlue once again my flight is delayed. I hope I dont miss my  connecting. Please don't fuck me... I have a girlfriend -_-
@AmericanAir now down to only one agent helping a stagnant line of almost 100 customers. Super.
@AmericanAir F-A-N-T-A-S-T-I-C!! thanks again for coming thru with great customer service!
@AmericanAir why can't @dfwairport have the capability to spread salt on a runway?!
@USAirways no we haven't because we've been in the same line at the service desk for an 1hr and 1/2 now in the same spot.
@JetBlue thank you for always have the most amazing customer service! Bring on The Disney Princess Half Marathon
@SouthwestAir yes please
@JetBlue 6 hour delay. Supposed to land at 9pm now it's 3am. Still not boarding. #EpicFail
@USAirways &amp; @AmericanAir what are your weight restrictions for carry on luggage? Can find measurements but not weight restrictions. TIA
@AmericanAir flight 1081 from IAD to LAX sat for more than 3hrs because ground crew couldn't drive in snow #badmgmt #AmericanAirlines
@AmericanAir the communications seems to be an issue too, no?

@USAirways thank you for correctly interpreting my last tweet as non sarcastic and delaying my flight again. YYZ Terminal 3 dance party?
@AmericanAir I was worried when my bag went SAN to DCA 24 hours before me. But our reunion was an organized  breeze! http://t.co/uOARyQ98PU
@USAirways Then told to offload because the captain was over hours? This has been a terrible experience.
@USAirways I spent more on the room &amp; transportation then I did the whole flight
@USAirways DOMINICK L. at La Guardia airport NYC gives the absolute best customer service! Thanku! Checking in made easy!
@USAirways thx for delayed checkin on noon flt to mia then forcing me to take Late Flightr flts which were delayed. Cincy to Miami in 13 hrs! #fast
@JetBlue I'm also a mosaic customer and fly jet blue ALOT....
@AmericanAir That's ok...You may keep my $25 and lose my bag with no info, but you no longer have my trust. Bad way to handle this.
@united offered me a voucher to switch flights. Now voucher offer doesn‚Äôt exist &amp; the gate agent switched me to a delayed flight!
@JetBlue we haven't even gotten off the plane yet! I can't afford to miss my flight back to Boston! Ugh.
@USAirways no worries, your flight attendant took care of it.
@united they are all -pilots, FA and ground personnel doing a great job. Weather is to blame... Who do I talk to about that :)
@USAirways thanks for the reply, hoping everything is cleared up in Charlotte by Monday
@USAirways 23 min on hold... Drove 2.5 hours to get my delayed bag. I just want to pick it up at SJU.
@JetBlue it was at JFK airport right now

@SouthwestAir I filled in the form on the website too. Darn it all. I guess I'll just have to cross my fingers.
Noooo don't do it, please don't do it üò©RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/lsxJI0oUvR‚Äù
@AmericanAir what I am put off by is the fact that no gate supervisor has tried to come by and communicate with us.

@JetBlue yes he and all the princesses. Trying to get to the #glassslipperchallenge at WDW.
@USAirways you are supposed to be in the business of belong customers; not humiliating them
@AmericanAir 2nd time in 4 days that my flight has been delayed and my gate agent hasn't said anything! Thanks for the memories. #NeverAgain
@AmericanAir is the company from hell with NO consideration for customers that give it hundreds of millions of dollars per year #SMH
@united Yesterday, I'm sorted now.
@AmericanAir everything's good now brothaaaaaa
@united Thanks for the reminder. It's been a fun ride. http://t.co/pPVA4Rch9f
@USAirways oh yay! Now gate agents decide not to deal with upgrade list and just bump up whoever is closest.
@AmericanAir Can care less if youre without your bags for a day or a week! Ive been 3 stories in the last 3 hours...I WANT MY BAG!
@united have Michelle at T1 ORD train your other staff on how to treat customers. A refreshing pleasure to deal with.
@SouthwestAir the person I talked to couldn't do anything not normally available online other than the "no charge" part.
@SouthwestAir When do you all expect to open the reservation through November?
@united Hi there, looks like my connection is delayed too so I'll make it. Thanks!

@united no thank you
@USAirways just an FYI I'll be writing registered letters 2 your ceo and those down the line 4 the shameful treatment and reactions we got.
@SouthwestAir aren't you based in Chicago? Why are you doing a hunt in LA and not your home city????!! Please bring one home
@JetBlue said they haven't started looking for it, gave me a $25-$100 limit. In NYC at the Waldorf Astoria and can't find $100 outfit. üòí
@SouthwestAir I'm an A-list Preferred customer and very loyal SWA. However, your inflight wifi is no better today than it was 4 years ago.
@AmericanAir @JimDayTV no, you couldn't care less. That's why their customer service is run by bots
@AmericanAir We have been sitting on this bird #AA1457 for 2 hrs on the dfw tarmac.  Some water would be nice.  Where's your manners?
@united ouch, delays due to mechanical issues again QRO will have to wait! Yall seem to be falling apart #alwaysdelayed #unitedfail
@united for the record- Rozana at Newark was lovely and helpful. #choosekind
@USAirways @AmericanAir How r u supposed to change flights when u can't get thru to reservations? #OneHourOnHold
@AmericanAir I need HELP!  I'm trying to Cancelled Flight a flight before it takes off but I can't get a hold of ANYONE because all lines are busy.
@united Why do I pay more for Coach Plus to be told preboarding that all overhead bins will be full for me
@AmericanAir Flight Cancelled Flightled, website refers to 1-800#, the 1-800# hangs up on me. Not auto-rebooked. Really? Horrible company.
@USAirways On re-accommodation number Lisa (Liza?) in Raleigh was very helpful
@united I'd thank you - but you didn't help.  taking 6 hours to reply (so I get a message in the middle of the night) isn't actually helpful
@united On the plane but thanks! Maybe don't let so many people check in by themselves - teeming with morons.
@united thnx
@united Who can I contact about requesting a charity donation? #ThankYou
@SouthwestAir I tried to return to orig booked flt. told overbooked.Gng to diff dest.Feel like we were switched on purpose bec of overbook.
@united you are terrible.
@USAirways yes. It says bag is being delivered. The local number says Not Open. Asked main # for cust service got hung up on.
@USAirways why are you letting us go to the runway if there are mechanical problems. #wewantcomps
@AmericanAir since we are leaving tomorrow to miami can you do one thing right and deliver the bags to the airport?
@JetBlue Port-Au-Prince, Haiti for continued food distribution, medical supplies, &amp; orphan care!  #flyingitforward http://t.co/fn2QXybT9K
@USAirways there is no extreme weather in Miami. Pick up the phone. Hire more people.
@united yes. We waited in line for almost an hour to do so. Some passengers just left not wanting to wait past 1am.
@united That doesn‚Äôt make any sense. I‚Äôve been 1K for over 5 years, and you‚Äôre making it harder to keep me loyal.
@united AN HOUR DELAY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PRINT A PIECE OF PAPER!
@united sent you my confirmation via DM. Thank you very much
@VirginAmerica Love the team running Gate E9 at LAS tonight. Waited for a delayed flight, and they kept things entertaining
@united follow me please this airline is beautifull ‚ô•
‚Äú@united: @mllovelace The baggage fee is waived for Premier members. Please see http://t.co/u6Duw27mDE. ^JP‚Äù what's the point of membership?
@JetBlue it was booked through work but added upgrade on seat. Need the upgrade receipt.
@USAirways i have been patient.. especially the first time. i will never fly with you again
@USAirways @AmericanAir as a Gold Dividends member, why can't I get anyone on phone to handle my Cancelled Flighted American flight tonight üò°
@USAirways 30 min delay for mechanics to replace rivets. 30 mins Late Flightr, turns out mechanics had wrong size rivets. 35 more mins. Pathetic
@united thanks for a terrible experience at EWR. Customers should be treated as a priority, not as an inconvenience #tryagain
@AmericanAir Thank you. It's much appreciated. We have been on the plane for 90 min now at the gate.
@JetBlue #flyingitforward Pereira, Colombia to help the kids from Cartago streets and deliver a lot of clothes that I have picked to donate.
@united I'm not know if the seats are actually narrower than other seats but they feel like it. Or maybe I'm extra bloated.
@SouthwestAir sent
@united Brian at SFO customer service deserves a raise, gave me extra meal voucher and a good joke to cheer me up after flight delay. #FTW
@USAirways thanks to the whole team for an on-time flight despite inclement weather http://t.co/eQePkkPSXM
@usairways I don't think the US site allows that (unlike http://t.co/etfjqIwUvt). Can I use a US credit if I held on http://t.co/etfjqIwUvt?
@USAirways PLANS CHANGED! IS THAT WHAT U CALL NOT BEIN ABLE 2 PARK ON TIME PLANES W A 2 HR LAYOVER N B ABLE 2 MAKE UR CONNECTION! #seriously
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/gHJBp5Gg67‚Äù why
@united has the best customer experience via twitter - huge fan!!!
@USAirways Trying to change my flight due to NYC travel advisory... your online system Cancelled Flighted my entire flight. Been on hold for over 1 hr
@AmericanAir all good! I'm catching the 11:10p flight tonight. Thanks for the response.
@SouthwestAir Show Jacksonville some üíùtoo!  We want #3ticketsforJax!
@SouthwestAir how do i know that my information is not found on other people's account?  I can see someone else's reservation, rr # and trip
@USAirways Stars aligned. Connecting flight was delayed into CLT. Made it! Thanks, glad to know someone is listening. Time for 80¬∞ in MoBay!
@AmericanAir What's with your baggage handlers calling out at DFW today? No luggage onboard the planes.
@united Slightly better. Crew spent a long time searching for better altitude. Would have helped to let pax in on why all the sharp drops.
@JetBlue @T5Sparrow Love it. They're cute
@JetBlue loving the free #wifi and #legroom ‚úàÔ∏è #SeattleBound
@AmericanAir Requiring customers to fill out all the contact information each time seems designed to prevent or limit interaction.
@SouthwestAir is offering #CompanionPasses to Atlanta residing frequent fliers! http://t.co/mdN5ED58ze
@AmericanAir "We'll drop off your luggage 24 hours after your flight" is ridiculous.
@JetBlue Happy Anniversary!! It's hard to believe you're 15!! You're so young!
@AmericanAir of course it wasn't your intention, issue lies in lack of response. she did contact you directly; she sat on hold for 50 mins
@SouthwestAir so for an extra luggage, it cost $75????
@AmericanAir More or less - after a night in a party hotel - no sleep and a 5:30 am rebook- on our way back to PHL http://t.co/4G0K0z2rei
@USAirways If I am traveling with an infant in my lap, is there anything I need to do to notify you?
@AmericanAir how can you not be taking calls? I need to change my flight!
@SouthwestAir departing MDW it's cold 26F, windy with snow on the ground for sunny and 70F las vegas  @LASairport http://t.co/2IR7ynMBdU
@SouthwestAir Thank you for having flights going out of Nashville! You guys Rock! #DisneyPrincessHalfMarathon #girlsweekend #bffs
@USAirways on hold for 2+ hours.. Can I book using a Take Flight voucher online??
@AmericanAir I'm willing to hold for an agent. you aren't being helpful you keep hanging up on me #americanairsucks #hiremorepoeple
@united I travel a lot and I get it. You're still my fave but EWR to Cleveland w/40 min layover to connect to DC = our best option? Come on.
@united wont transfer flight ticket to accompany an 11 yr old who's active military mom had to have emergency brain surgery? WOW!!
@USAirways thanks! Any idea when it will be resolved? I'd like to purchase my ticket!
@VirginAmerica I was scheduled for SFO 2 DAL flight 714 today. Changed to 24th due weather. Looks like flight still on?
@JetBlue and ask she load the bag for my flight
@united Stuck in. ORD because United can't find their airplane. Lol. #upset terminal right now.
@SouthwestAir IM NOT THO üò≠üò≠üíîüíîüíîüíîüíîüíîüíî
@SouthwestAir @karajusto SWA is willing to follow up. FINALLY.
@USAirways is there gonna be a better day to call? I've called on 3 separate occasions the past couple of weeks and never get to a person.
@SouthwestAir got it squared away. Thank you. I had a man on the inside help me out!
@SouthwestAir please acknowledge Attendant Jeff Wernicke. Beat in class and service on SW
@USAirways horrible service, wrong plane arrived, many confirmed passengers could not get on flight we paid for due to lack of seats flight
@USAirways I'm referring to email like this.  Just tell people when they GET the upgrade. Otherwise, we know already. http://t.co/N8UvCLMADA
@usairways HI again! How you suggested I contacted u via phone, sent a mail with the original ticket &amp; the result: http://t.co/214i0RTIH4
@USAirways @satesq theres only one flt PHL-CRW per day.
@AmericanAir why do you continually play the "according to federal regulations" every 58 seconds. I could see if you had quicker service...
@SouthwestAir THANK YOU for finally making your boarding passes work with passbook
@VirginAmerica - Your site seems a little wonked right now. May want to have a look. Tried on two browsers. No CSS? http://t.co/8qsQMM7KF2
@JetBlue I don't want JetBlue +TV. I want JetBlue +WIFI :(((
@SouthwestAir can you follow and we'll proceed?
@united okay ase24766m. Find our luggage.
@SouthwestAir Your wifi stinks. I'm not mad, but i wouldn't hate it if i got my money refunded.
@AmericanAir No apology necessary. It was wind and I was on Delta. XOXO
@united Arriving 25 minutes early is nice, but not if equipment isn't ready. Waiting 30 minutes for luggage, so far. Time gains wiped out.
@USAirways On hold for &gt;70 mins on my 3rd attempt just to get a receipt showing change fees for an upcoming flight. Please help!
@united So excited I was put on an earlier flight to get home! Woo Hoo! #travel üéâüéâüéâ
@united getting ready to book a flight to San Juan. Was wondering, Does United waive baggage fees for military personnel. Thanks.
@united and after being on hold for an hour the day before to sort it out and being told it's fine it should be fine when you arrive to fly
@united spends 20 minutes beating up a lady about her bag fees.  Random stranger comes up and pays the fee.  #Randomactsofcorporategreed
@USAirways I've been on hold for 41min. Just trying to change my reservation.
@AmericanAir I have been waiting at this airport since 11 am and have to wait until 8:30 tomorrow and cannot get any sort of help!
@USAirways YOU ARE THE BEST!!! YOU ARE AMAZING!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE;)üôèüôèüôè
@AmericanAir , I was told my flights 2516 &amp; 2244 was Cancelled Flightled. But I don't seem to have any date/time changes. I've been waiting for a call
@JetBlue yes, 3 times. I need some one to call me and help me change a flight. I can't do online. Thanks.
@JetBlue well I'm not sure I'm that bold! lol or are you saying you didn't believe me?? :P
@SouthwestAir Redeem-points packages magically gone by time we finally got through @ 10:01, felt like #baitandswitch
@JetBlue I left my apt 10hrs ago to go from Boston to SJC and I'm still NYC. Please bring back the nonstop flight. #jetblueBlues
@united negative. Done wasting time with amateurs at customer service. Thanks for at least offering.
@SouthwestAir alist pref doesn't do any good if direct to atl is always wifiless. Flight 1701.
@VirginAmerica everything was fine until you lost my bag
@JetBlue Hey guys! Your Flight Booking Problems system ran my first and middle names together at time of Flight Booking Problems. Is that going to be a #TSAnightmare ?
@JetBlue thank you :-)
@USAirways 2102 DCA-BOS. Cancelled Flightled after making us wait over an hour. If I fly USAir every week can you upgrade my status proactively?
@JetBlue continue button generated a trip to "plan your trip page"regardless of how far along I was in Flight Booking Problems processhint: the end of it
@SouthwestAir very poor customer service thru out each of my cxl flightsüòî I should've flew @Delta
@USAirways I finally got through on the phone after a 2 hour wait time.
@USAirways new slogan should be "if you don't want to arrive on time, pick us"
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/Q16Xvwg0L6‚Äù .... I have to refrain what I want to say
@united They couldn't get me first class on any of their flights so I just rebooked myself.
@JetBlue thank you for help and quick response
@USAirways How do I get through?
@united just informed you don't reimburse for issues due to weather. this is why your flights keep getting Cancelled Flightled--Thor hates you
@USAirways Do you have a phone Nbr for Refund Dept ?
@SouthwestAir why can't you help me after you made mistake and dropped my early bird check in on your end?  Where is the LUV?
@united flight #1051 on 2/23. Thx
@USAirways absolutely worst experience of my life at PHL. 6 hrs, 1 failed departure, 3 gates, and ZERO communication or help!!
@JetBlue 266 at LGB in Sunny So Cal http://t.co/V015PK7DSi
@SouthwestAir really appreciate the follow up, I always fly with y'all for a reason!
@united boarded 6373 on time, deplaned, and now 100 minutes delay. No transparency during. Can't wait to give up my gold status for AA.
@VirginAmerica always!!! Xoxo
@USAirways here we go again. Same flight as last week. Delayed already 45 mins. Think the 7:15 can leave PHL before 1:15 am? #waitingagain
@JetBlue well they said Cancelled Flight on the PA system. Guess they are trying to get a plane from Boston. And not a 100%  confirmed
@united thx. Come hell or high water...
@SouthwestAir Make the world a better place: Visit an elderly relative.
@united These are great fares!!!!!
@USAirways ticket couldnt be used bc unable to get to departing dest (RSW) bc of blizzard in BOS. Told only way to use credit is $200 fine
@united social media team is on point on #OscarNight :)
@AmericanAir that is absolutely false stmt.  You have a comedy of errors incl no catering etc #GetYourActTogether
@united I DM'd child's birthdate and full name.
@JetBlue flight 462 to Boston delayed due to weather in Tampa?
@united done
@USAirways @AmericanAir can someone please tell me who I have to talk to #getittogether #findurgrip
@USAirways this day has been a disaster, rude employees, no help &amp; now no hotel. not flying with you again &amp; I fly ALOT! Dallas=raise=now!
@JetBlue @pilyoc dont talk about my friend @JetBlue like that. #thefutureisweird
@united no, it was 2 flight Cancelled Flightlations (one due to weather, one mechanical) paid own hotel, bag held in transfer. No voucher/compensation
@JetBlue WHAT'S UP WITH WEBSITE CAN'T ACCESS FLIGHT INFO
@JetBlue yes, with about 20 minutes to spare.  FYI - your employees are amazing.  Keep up the good work!
@AmericanAir yes, and rebooked incorrectly.
how sway how ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/tQc96tKcI9‚Äù
@united you are really trying me today.
@VirginAmerica  - Is Flight 713 from Love Field to SFO definitely Cancelled Flightled for Monday, February 23?
@united customers ‚úÖ. Customer service ‚ùå http://t.co/qP6Aw3nLIP
@JetBlue üò≠ I used points can I get them back if I decide not to go?
@SouthwestAir Yes I know that. Also noticed you offer A list boarding after A60. So your programs are too popular.
@USAirways does anyone actually work at the dividend miles department? http://t.co/BgtJFmnEOT
@JetBlue heard about the charge for 1st bag and tighter seats - no need to be a loyal JB customer anymore!
@united pls properly train your agents. Requested to speak to 1k customer service &amp; was transferred to a dead end. Not even open at this hr
@united big surprise #nogate waiting for our plane. Same fucken issues everything I fly you. #fail #worstairlineever
@USAirways my bag is still lost and I can not get anyone on the phone to assist me and the tracking updates have stopped
.@SouthwestAir Yes, total of 4 hours on hold. With all the Cancelled Flightlations, one would think there would be more staff. Decided to cx and drive
@AmericanAir also the problem is not calling us at all. Other airlines send an automatic call and email, and they rebook as a courtesy.
@united if I miss the #Oscars I'll never fly united again
@USAirways You will be hearing a lot more from me instead of your feedback when I get back home.
@USAirways Now the next plane had a broken seat!  My row!  Another hour delay!  #mad
@USAirways is the absolute worst airline. 13 women were inconvenienced due to maintenance issues. Stuck all over- no care given.
@VirginAmerica Really? Sprint? I thought you guys were 'kewl'! 0_0
@SouthwestAir Am I flying on Spirit air?
@united It's still a valid flight. Just seems strange to delay for Late Flight inbound crew,  7 hours from now, when the plane is already here.
@VirginAmerica @JezzieGoldz would have been a rough trip but LUCKILY we were on a #virginamerica flight. #weather
@united yes, a paper voucher that I got on January 26th 2015
@united love being told you would issue a refund when you couldn't get us out of the way of a hurricane to have it denied
@SouthwestAir your app repeatedly crashed and failed to display my name when checking in. Was unable to use app. http://t.co/0kN7PjelZL
@SouthwestAir Thanks for the info! Have a good day.
@JetBlue *cough* #awkward!
@USAirways that's where we are now. Thank you.
@AmericanAir I will thank you. What do I do if I can't get through and my flight on hold Cancelled Flights?
@VirginAmerica "You down with RNP?" "Yeah you know me!"
@SouthwestAir if you have a rules you should probably apply them all the times not just sometimes. #shouldhaveflownjetblue
@USAirways What was the point of the merger?  Why not just go out of business if your not turning a profit anymore?
@USAirways On hold for an hour...connected to the wrong department by your automated system...transferred and now another 45 min &amp; counting
@united Your MileagePlus signup page is broken.
@AmericanAir great job and great service in and out of SDF this weekend during the winter storm.
@JetBlue I think it's safe to say that after 25 years of loyal #JetBlue flying we are officially DONE. #Byebyejetblue
@USAirways @AmericanAir 3 hours on hold got rebooked on a new flight yesterday. I asked for a new itinerary/confirmation email to be sent
@AmericanAir your advantage agents are horrible! I've been waiting for 5 hours for a call back only to be hung up on by a rude agent!
@VirginAmerica there is something wrong with you website in Safari iPhone
@AmericanAir Stuck on a plane at JFK: food was not on the plane now we need to wait crew to push back the plane. Good job, AA!
@AmericanAir It's our honeymoon,I paid extra business. I was sitting next to my bride, you bumped me because of status. Disgusted
@united Well, to the degree that he could... Just to know, after this experience I'm Cancelled Flighting my miles card. Thank god for @Delta
@JetBlue Complete waste of an entire day. Pathetic.
@JetBlue I understand but everyone said different things and there was a flight out Late Flightr that night but only one of us got to take it
@AmericanAir come on I just want to go home I can't miss another day of work #stuckinmemphis #texasisclosed
@AmericanAir it's not a friend it's a legally required chaperone on a school trip.
@USAirways ...Loosing a lot of business by using Barclays. I cant believe that you cant apply for a card if you live in Iowa.
@SouthwestAir just added #passbook support to their iOS application! Finally, I get to add them to my collection. http://t.co/lEdNoCdQee
@united Thanks!  Good to know.
@USAirways can I get an update on flight 680 to DCA?
@SouthwestAir how many are left?!
@SouthwestAir could care more about their customer, if there is a reasonable request :(
@JetBlue I was believing you for a minute, but we just got delayed for a 3rd time!
@SouthwestAir have a prompt for consumers for prompt for customer service instead of having customers on hold for 1.5 hrs
Lines may be extra long or security slow, but seems your employees too quick to blame customers who don't arrive 3-4 hours ahead @JetBlue
@united I‚Äôve filled out the form twice. No email. I have a lost item code. Can you verify it was received?
@SouthwestAir Received email w/reso's to my email that isn't associated to SWA account I own with CC info for my sister. #FRAUD please DM me
@SouthwestAir everyones flights who were Cancelled Flightled today DESERVE 1
@SouthwestAir was fantastic! That's the best flight service I've ever had.
@SouthwestAir can't wait! Thanks for the response!‚ù§Ô∏è
@united how about changing RNO -DEN non-stop In May (9) from 6am to Late Flight morning or early afternoon?
@SouthwestAir link doesn't work
@USAirways flight 1777 has been waiting for 30 minutes at RSW waiting for weight balance clearance. Come on, let us leave!
@AmericanAir thanks - I miss my dog and this delay is costing me a lot of money.
@SouthwestAir I understand a delay but to be stuck on the plane longer than the flight is unacceptable
@united my friend lost luggage on flight 1547. What to do?
@AmericanAir anything in particular I should ask for.   Will they want me to document my mileage plus status!
@SouthwestAir when will airfare be available through December of this year? I have 2 major trips coming up and I'm anxious to book them!
@USAirways doesn't want me to get home
@JetBlue I spent an hour on the phone with customer service only to find out that they can't help. Need help with family pooling asap.
@united your airline has been telling me that my luggage is one hour away from my destination for 5 days!
@AmericanAir DMing you now! Big thanks.
@AmericanAir - AA1344 Cancelled Flighted on 2.23 - rebooked on us air 623/544 on 2.24. Has to be a nonstop on 2.24 for us (2)?
@USAirways 2day: no coffee &amp; 1 working toilet.  Then I read domestic airlines whining re: foreign competition.  Coincidence?  No  #openskies
@AmericanAir  Mad love http://t.co/4ojrSDWPkK NYC-
@united roundtrip tickets to NJ are DRAMATICALLY cheaper through Virgin, pretty pricey via United. Can you match them?
@united No. Denver said they don't handle baggage that made it to Colo. Springs.  They gave me an 800 number to call. No help there either.
@JetBlue, was far less painful than what was coming from Avis.  üíô
@AmericanAir but your flight crews &amp; ground crews have handled situation well. Texting notification let me catch a few winks during delay.
@AmericanAir Your rubbish at Social Media! In the air two hours Late Flight but that's better than being Cancelled Flightled!
@USAirways How do I get a receipt for a change fee when I originally booked with miles?
@SouthwestAir yeah, all 4 are rebooked for tomorrow AM. Hoping the 3rd time is a charm for no Cancelled Flightled flights!
@USAirways yes but lost a whole day.  Frustrating!!  #poor customer service
@SouthwestAir our flight is delayed till tomorrow curse the weather
@SouthwestAir unfortunately once the call was answered service was horrid. SWA was the role-model of finger pointing &amp; excuses #DISAPPOINTED
@united have better customer service at John Wayne airport.
@USAirways will you please update your website with the most current flight status? And update your customer service phone # on @google thx
@united Nope, still sitting at the gate!
@united UA6002 MLI-&gt;DEN. Will miss connection UA3530 DEN-&gt;YEG due to delay.
@JetBlue 2 words: "staff training." What a joke-
@AmericanAir HELP! Attempting to Cancelled Flight a flight but can't get thru 800 number. Call gets dropped when saying Agent. flight is 2/24.
@united booked flight in sept to get best price for April to usa, checked now and they are ‚Ç¨67 cheaper, what a con unhappy customer #ripoff
@AmericanAir anything you can do?
@AmericanAir check your dm pls
‚Äú@SouthwestAir: @kirkwoodtiger Hmmm... how does the Caribbean sound? https://t.co/AAY5avg99b ^LD‚Äù WARM THANKS!
@united Seat 14A, Flight UA895
@USAirways No I was there 12 hrs early! Send me an email to share my experience You don't want this blasting here.
@united 1k member broken seat back broken tv broken light lost bag  gee thnx. UA922 awesome job
@AmericanAir How clueless is AA. Been waiting to hear for 2.5 weeks about a refund from a Cancelled Flightled flight &amp; been on hold now for 1hr 49min
@AmericanAir @dogbuckeye No, I was on hold for 4 1/2 hours.  3 diff agents each w/ different information, frustrating, kept getting txfd...
@USAirways It's not double booked. I spoke with CS and we've got a plan to fix this. It's still an amateur mistake that should never happen.
@AmericanAir That's a complete cop out! U ask what the issues are, then do nothing about it. How are we supposed to sort the situation now?
@united that's cool - now what?
@united I log in, view reservations, try view specific reservation &amp; takes me back to login page,
@united how about plowing the snow at a gate before the plane arrives so we don't sit for 45 minutes after an 8 hr flight.... Fail
@AmericanAir could you check if there is SWU (typo in last post) space on AA199 MXP-JFK Feb 28th? Thanks
@AmericanAir I have been trying to get through to someone about my Cancelled Flightled flight tomorrow for over 4 hours.
@AmericanAir you're airline is ridiculous
@united make sure you make Cancelled Flighted flight baggage and upgrade fees seem like a labyrinth so that you might be able to swindle a few $ more
@SouthwestAir you are lucky to have people like Annamarie and Norris at BWI. I hope they get recognized for excellent cust. service
@JetBlue look what I capture at Uvf http://t.co/Lj2ZXZN8kG
@USAirways @GregWallace66 Yea, they will give you 5 cents on the dollar!
@USAirways ticket counter people here are not helping and just want to charge more money even after this horrible day.
@united how is Mexico not international from the us?
@AmericanAir wow @AmericanAir still screw n stuff up
@JetBlue that wasn't delayed or cabcelled
@AmericanAir since you don't care about what happens to your passengers on your planes we will now be contacting the Police Dept
@JetBlue Love you guys sooooooo much. Ridiculously appreciated! A+ service!
@AmericanAir please fix your inventory system, Plat upgraded then bumped DOWN after boarding, FA said they made a mistake. AA45 3A‚û°Ô∏è8C üòï
@united 16 days for one flight and 8 for the other (roundtrip).
@united booked EWR-FLL in first for two on 3-8. Let's see how you compare to the garbage @AmericanAir first class has become
@AmericanAir you all should really be ashamed. The entire business class cabin is empty and almost all of first class...
@SouthwestAir one of my bags didn't make it to my destination. I have the claim ticket. Any way to help out with a status on the location?
@united please see a flight attendant for what? Why isn't there enough room for over head bags? I carry on to save time!!!
@AmericanAir I'm booked for Tuesday night. 60 degrees in Alabama right now. I'm good. Stay warm and safe.
@SouthwestAir give us some more clever advertising about #bagsflyfree is that because #badpolicy allows you to #cheatcustomers
@USAirways been on hold for 39 minutes and counting for a month old change fee refund request for a funeral.  This is pathetic.
@united Not encouraged that I'll have my CPAP tonight.
@AmericanAir but at least your automated message gives me info about your merger w/ @USAirways. Another airline I know to avoid.
@USAirways I just think it's weird to have mileage as 666
@VirginAmerica  DREAM http://t.co/oA2dRfAoQ2 http://t.co/lWWdAc2kHx
@USAirways stuck on the ramp at DCA, US Air computer system crashed...everywhere.
@United You were doing so well until the PHL-SFO flight yesterday. Major miss. Unfriendly Premier cabin crew. Baggage cluster at SFO.
@united how are conditions in BOS today? I'm in UA994. Everything appears to be in time but I wanted to check.
@JetBlue excellent. you guys are the best
@united what's the point of asking for details about a #servicedog when you book if your flight crew doesn't read them? (Continued)
@AmericanAir you have a company policy that refuses employees to speak to other employees over the phone? Interesting
@SouthwestAir If you read my tweet it is a gap in process for folks that take multiple flights in one day.
@AmericanAir  flight from DFW to LIT tomorrow has been Cancelled Flightled.  What do I do next?  Pls advise.  #HELP
@SouthwestAir Where should I fly by May 3rd? Plz advise.
@united your staff at LaGuardia and Lagos, Nigeria were unprofessional, uncaring and not helpful. Ou
Why even ask me to DM you and offer help if you "can't do anything" @united #terriblecustomerservice #unitedairlines http://t.co/feC4i3Vwq7
@AmericanAir second, she sat on the Tarmac for 3 hrs only to be told it would be 30 mins
@USAirways it's be nice to take a flight and have some level of consistency / service from the flight attendants. Quality control???
@SouthwestAir On flight 771 tomorrow (Wed 2/18) DEN-BNA. Will we be delayed or Cancelled Flightled?
@USAirways looks like our bag has been rescued. Thanks!
@AmericanAir we did check before going to de airport and everything was fine. #fail
@JetBlue Haha. I figured that. I was meaning there's no return flights out of Charlotte. It's like N/A for a week plus
@united tried to check it 40 mins before a flight rather than 45 mins and we are stonewalled by your employees...
@SouthwestAir not at all. Rerouted to snowy BWI been trying to figure out how to get out of here. Now dealing with more baggage troubles.
@USAirways it's been three weeks since I was specifically told I would get a call back from your folks in AZ- should I keep being patient?
@SouthwestAir well my mom called earlier and you guys had her on hold for close to an hour
@AmericanAir I need to be back home tomorrow and no one is helping me. Please help me rebook for a flight tomorrow!
@JetBlue's CEO battles to appease passengers and Wall Street - Waterbury Republican American http://t.co/IMVMpnQXAI
@USAirways well, depending on the policy will make the determination as to which airline is selected to travel.
@united thanks for effing up our holidays - we're missing a full day of skiing due to your baggage team's incompetence at @FlyYOW
@AmericanAir I loved todays fight. But there was a bad draft on the airplane please add more air to air thanksm
@SouthwestAir still waiting. Just hit one hour.
@united UA1740 just admit you have no clue when flight will leave Denver. #unfriendlyskies
@JetBlue yes slc on 4/19
@united done just now, thanks.
@AmericanAir can you tell me why all flights from XNA 2 DFW are Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow morning already?
@united i think he actually did not like your screen  @campilley üòÉüòÉüòÉ
@AmericanAir Bad weather is understandable but your own pilot said that over 160 people called out and that ZERO bags are on the plane.
LMAO ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/aIyC9WV5oq‚Äù
@USAirways I was supposed to be on flight 1861 from Charlotte to RDU @ 8:20pm yesterday. Is the same flight scheduled for departure tonight?
@AmericanAir not to mention its a three hour wait to get an agent on the phone.
@AmericanAir I'm on 1024 into Dallas. Do I have any chance of catching 2238 to Boston? Do I need to run from Gate D6 to A15?.
@JetBlue they miraculously fixed the plane #kudos to shoe ever it was
@AmericanAir Got my bags this morning! Thanks!
@united your customer service is terrible
@united I‚Äôm resending the confirmation code in a DM
@united Thanks! Just DMed HN.
@JetBlue check DM please :)
@united Missed KTM flight due to ur Cancelled Flightlation. Mike supervisor disgusting.  Now day Late Flight. No apology or upgrade offer to LHR from ORD???
@united just did! Thank you!
@USAirways @SeanVRose Sean - keep in mind if you call...plan on being on hold for 3+ hours
@USAirways done
@united then why have I not received my call back its been 3 days...it's an infant car seat how am I supposed to go anywhere with my child
@united traveling with 3 young kids!! Chose our original flights for a reason.
@AmericanAir I didn't miss my flight.  American Airlines gave my ticket, as well as 6 other passengers tickets away. Not my fault.
@AmericanAir it has been almost 4 hours and I have heard nothing yet from your reservations team. What am I supposed to do?
@JetBlue wow you guys answer people wow you care I love jet blue
@USAirways can I at least get a response?  I tried the gate person (sent me the wrong way to cust srvc ) Cust Srvc (when I found them)
@SouthwestAir not very helpful trying to get out of Nashville.Should waive change fee for 2/18.
@united @staralliance Very nice at LHR, congrats, but I'm sticking with AA/#BA. @AmericanAir @British_Airways
@united After an hour+ wait, my issue is resolved. I did contact customer service to comment on the wait time. Thanks for contacting me.
@JetBlue Its poor Flight management. There is   no reason why a scheduled 8:00  pm  flight to takr off At 11:00pm .
@united for an early flt, I think a call is appropriate. Yes, reviewed and nada avail until next day. Expect full refund
@JetBlue - why does my TSA-pre work with every airline BUT you? I pay good money for that. Spent 30 mins on phone to fix to zero success.
@SouthwestAir it's ok I was supposed to be in California 5hrs ago
@united If United loses your baggage they will get it to the airport in the country your in and then it disappears!
@SouthwestAir humor aside, we've been stuck on the plane for two hours at the gate because bags can't be loaded correctly. What gives?
@USAirways how aggravating, zone 5 boarded, overhead empty but forcing bag check. Better not loose bag again! flt1727 http://t.co/w3XS6TVpZg
@united. It's not my first time flying to the US. I have medical info. Looking for practical like my adapted seat cushion allowed on?
@AmericanAir plz kys I have been sitting in this plane for an hour I want to leave
@JetBlue @Airbus  Wow, awesome videos guys https://t.co/dbcvEPn5QC Great work. #Bluemanity #CoreValues  #Passion #AeroJobMarket #avgeek
@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine great news.
@SouthwestAir listening center is open seating just like on their planes. #RaganDisney
@united - terrible experience on UA415 on 17th. 1st exit row in economy has zero legroom. Have same row booked for return but can't change.
@united Why have you never held a plane for me? #HourDelay #MultipleDoorOpeningAndClosing #DangerOfGettingSnowedIn
@AmericanAir another day another grievance with this airline. No customer service
@united why do you bother surveying me!
@JetBlue great smooth flight too! üëèüëç
@AmericanAir not only on both legs did I have damaged seat, u damaged an expensive case and not offered anything.Just an apology 6wks Late Flightr!
@united thank you! Excited to be working with you guys!
@USAirways Yep, except this delay was due to a hasty and unwise decision to pushback other plane before the plows were done. #fail.
@united has not responded to my various requests for contact numbers, does anyone know the UK customer service number for #UnitedAirlines
@SouthwestAir done. Sorry, I thought I was already.
@united Thanks for the upgrade- please try to get my company to approve more business class travel.
@USAirways so the seat next to me (19B) on flight 1943 to Seattle has a tray table that is falling off... http://t.co/HAJ5lKqjW4
@USAirways worked w/ Tiffany H at cust service desk in Charlotte and she was helpful and patient. Still stuck, but she was great.
@SouthwestAir please please please answer the phone. . .
@united is flight number 1142 Denver to Las Vegas 1125 on Sunday feb 22 Cancelled Flighted ?
@USAirways @AmericanAir who runs the show at the airport have a boarding pass says us airways and I have to wait in American line #yousuck
@united  Great customer service again. Thanks!
@AmericanAir Thanks, but that results in missing the conference I'm attending. Are there options to book earlier,or if not,receive a refund?
@JetBlue Another awesome telephone experience with @JetBlue Thank you, Cory! #Greatcustomerservice‚úà‚ò∫
@jetblue having trouble signing in to TrueBlue today, despite right credentials. getting "We are not able to sign you in" msg.
@SouthwestAir sent!
@AmericanAir is the worst airline in the entire world. I only flew them because I had to and it was the nightmare I knew it would be.
@SouthwestAir I hope you're happy! You have officially become the next @AmericanAir #ProfitBeforePeople IMO you will be bankrupt by 2020
@united jx4s2t if you can out today would be great it's our honeymoon and this delay you has put a damper on iy
@USAirways connection made. Thanks again this week. #daddyshome
@USAirways Not happy with start of trip!  Cancelled Flightled flight #poor customerservice
@SouthwestAir I'm on the 10:55 flight! Everyone has been so nice and helpful! I'm just hoping we'll get to fly out! Thank you! ;)
@SouthwestAir couldn't be bothered to help with my lost my luggage. Not a single helpful employee owner to be found in BWI.
@AmericanAir My flt AA375 for 02/23 got cncled and i cant get hold of a CSR so i can get alternate arrangement. Plz help
@AmericanAir and how is this not a mechanical issue? All evidence points to the idea that it‚Äôs the ILS at CLL at fault, not the weather.
@AmericanAir is DFW accepting any arrivals or departures today?
@AmericanAir there is two hour wait
@united is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do
@USAirways found the tix#, security code not working. Tried a dozen times.
@JetBlue They weren't on any flight, they just came Late Flight. Your JetBlue employee just informed us!
@SouthwestAir opened online applications for Fall 2015 intern positions throughout the company.  Apply via https://t.co/GmL7ot3IMH
@AmericanAir not enough push crews for JFK = 1.5 he delay and counting....
@united your service need work - check out this Bush airport "customer service line" last nt #unitedagainstunited http://t.co/g00sAozgtv
@JetBlue thx, social media person!
@united, no. Re-booked with American and United said they'd transfer our bags to them.
@USAirways a $100 @Samsonite - totaled. Not happy. Not at all.
@JetBlue Great flight, as always! Thank you to the great crew on flight 475! #travel #jetblue
@united And then when we asked the stewardess to take the disinfectant wipe as trash she said, "not with my hands!" #badservice
@SouthwestAir been on hold for over an hour to speak to a customer service rep. What the heck?? #Southwest #customerservice
@USAirways yes I did thank you! They did a great job turning the flight in jan !
Yes, I filed a report in Atlanta. My bags are in Charlotte, NC. 24 hours Late Flightr and still can't find my luggage ... @USAirways
@united During the same round trip, my NON-English speaking friend was stranded TWICE for 12+ hours each time! Most staff members were rude.
@JetBlue Third straight time that my flight has been delayed flying with you guys. This will be my last trip with you.
@united how can you not know the weight of our plane after us sitting on the plane for 2.5 hrs? Not convinced your company is safe for flt.
@united in fact he received my boarding pass
@AmericanAir flight home Cancelled Flightled today.  Any way we can get another flight to NYC from Texas? 4 hour wait for a call back from airline
@SouthwestAir eyes next steps for improving #inflight #Wifi - Runway Girl http://t.co/h46HT1Oz40
@AmericanAir been @ airport 8hrs been told nothing by anyone until now your rep has said "we are waiting for the mechanics to finish lunch"!
@AmericanAir #2298. Everyone else  was outstanding.
@SouthwestAir do you have special fares for students to visit prospective schools?  It's expensive to visit graduate programs.
@united what's the status of flight 1008 Bogot√°-Houston?
@JetBlue what's good with a Miami terminal?
@united you could give me free flights for life, and I'd still choose to purchase my tickets from a competitor.
@AmericanAir pls tell me how to get a person on the phone asap
@SouthwestAir 4/9/14, I need to fly from GSP to DSM, but claims there's no sched. avail.  I can book separately, but why not together?
@AmericanAir thank you for NOT Cancelled Flighting all flights and putting my husbands life in danger driving in this weather. #safetyfirst
@United an idea: monitor mileage members travel patterns enough to know when they change jobs/lose status...and make the transition easier.
@SouthwestAir My 11AM was canned. I empathize. But I think your Team has lost the right to be capitalized. It's a lowercase team day.
@JetBlue does not fit in 140
@JetBlue gorgeous day, hope the flight back tomorrow AM is just as pleasant! Thanks
@SouthwestAir I have never had such awful customer service and conflicting service. Outrageous.
@USAirways It was US 893. The gate was open after about 50 mins waiting. What a great way to finish an 18 hour delayed arrival!!
@AmericanAir When will callers from the East Coast be able to speak to an actual human for reservation support? All agents busy call Late Flightr..
@united I have been given a connection with 2 overnight layovers. No vouchers. Last connection not even confirmed.
@SouthwestAir Glad it was finally resolved too. Too bad I can't get a free voucher to go with mine so I can have a friend travel next time!
@USAirways thank you for refunding my bag fee.  I look forward to its return today I hope.
@JetBlue Gotcha... but "lessening the delay" ... that part's not happening, right?
@AmericanAir now I have to wait "more than 60 minutes"
@SouthwestAir How many trees have to die before you stop trying to sell us a credit  card? #OptOut http://t.co/CXrZhcdTVz
@united #unitedairlines so is it 6:20 pm or 12:20?   ORD ABQ 3709.   I can't even take a walk without missing a change.
@united 3359 which you finally Cancelled Flightled.
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/UHUmAskLdv‚Äù
@USAirways ...YOU ARE DESPICABLE! The flight plan was lost! Now we've been sitting on the tarmac for an hour! Its a 45 min flight!
@united for a fee...
‚Äú@SouthwestAir: Congrats to these fans who are seeing #DestinationDragons in L.A.! SLC, you're next! http://t.co/YcCITaeP3S‚Äù Thanks again SW
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/tLGoihqkvS‚Äù üòê make it stop.
@united  what is the real deal with the delay on flight UA 1032 from Denver to Vegas?
@USAirways Your gate team are polite. But your planes are habitually Late Flight. In many cases, passengers are waiting for the flight crew!
@USAirways but the automated message says the line is too busy to join the queue! #stuckintheloop
@JetBlue do you have any afternoon flights going from BQN to JFK? I only seem to find early morning flights.
@AmericanAir the pilot her and another flight attendant left walking away laughing.  Just wow
@SouthwestAir This experience was the worse flying experience I've ever had. To be met w/ contempt from your Customer Service makes it worse
@SouthwestAir hasn't evennotified us that theflight isdelayed via email/text/phone call.If we wererunning Late Flight I would be pissed #unreliable
@JetBlue spoken to 2 reps. Once I'm allowed to check my bag and through the TSA checkpoint, I guarantee I will be talking to someone.
@AmericanAir that's if it is ever complete and if i can ever get through customer service #theydontanswer
@SouthwestAir used to exclusively fly SW, but Late Flightly, direct flights &amp; cheaper costs have me switched. üòî why...so... few...direct...flights?
@SouthwestAir ..just booked trip to Cancun...‚ù§Ô∏è no baggage fees..but need to have more flight time options
@southwestair *any site*?   gmail, facebook, etc.
@united 5 gate changes, two delays.  Even the crew thinks the airline sucks
@united not 100% sure, however my ticket included one checked bag, therefore this charge was extra and completely unanticipated.
@united yes lots. You have terrible customer service at Newark and despite raising a complaint there we were ignored hence the tweet
@united can I request a ticket change through twitter ?
@AmericanAir finally made it to chicago - 13 hours Late Flight.  Did get a $12 food voucher for my wait.about $1per/hr. Never again. Good bye.
@JetBlue Lekvhg want to see what the cost would be to change to the 430 flight
@AmericanAir from the rude ticket counter employees to forcing my wife on standby and then pushing her down the list.. it was a very bad day
@USAirways 4 hours Late Flightr And i lost my conection üò°
@united All these changes. Way to stick it to your Premiere 1K loyal customers. Why make things harder for those that loyal to you?
@usairways trick for getting into your hold queue?  I've been calling since Thursday and keep getting the "call back Late Flightr" message
@SouthwestAir thanks for linking to #Passbook. Might be old news but this is my first 2015 flight.
@united the Premier desk was able to rebook me with our friends at @AmericanAir. Only problem is now I have to pay for a checked bag :/
@JetBlue? | RT @WMCActionNews5: New airline expected to make its way to MEM http://t.co/Gbd5R1OlSI
@united She is travelling from Melbourne (Australia ) to Bogota (Colombia) tomorrow
@USAirways they finally answered. They were rude and didn't help me at all.
@united Bad coffee, but the juice is ok. #GetPhilz @ United Terminal SFO Airport http://t.co/Sg7IQqFVsO
@SouthwestAir I was on hold for two hours and finally hung up. I was able to do what I needed to without customer service eventually.
@united Thank you for your response!
@AmericanAir yes....twice...for two different flights and occasions
‚Äú@USAirways: We're sincerely sorry, Sean. Reservations is working hard to answer everyone's call and we appreciate your patience.‚Äù #false
@united returned from vacation + went to luggage services. Golf bag was presented in clear wrap that could've been used in the first place.
@AmericanAir thanks. Delivery status??
@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine Congratulations!

@jetblue always #mosaicmecrazy #sunrise #bestairline #nofilterneeded &amp; how can you not love #FlyFi‚Ä¶ http://t.co/NY6CS7jRuV
@united LGJW7B. I voluntarily rerouted; 1st leg of journey was in economy and was supposed to be 8B. Res agent said she'd reserve it for me
@USAirways how is it possible that you don't have a call back service? An automated message telling us to call back Late Flightr is so unhelpful.
@united Premier Gold desk changes flight. Waives fees. Gives me wrong flight. Now Jana Acosta in Salt Lake refuses the same service. Angry.
@VirginAmerica And now the flight Flight Booking Problems site is totally down. Folks, what is the problem?
@united unacceptable. 403 was 90 min Late Flight for a 'missing screw' our flight to Tucson left before we even landed
@AmericanAir I have tried to talk to someone for almost 6 hrs! you Cancelled Flightled my flight and you won't pick up the phone. pathetic &amp; very sad

@JetBlue we are delayed, until he arrives
I always look forward to JB RT @JetBlue: @bostongarden :) Looking forward to welcoming you onboard! üíô
@JetBlue thanks anyways @SouthwestAir has my back! Awesome rate &amp; amazing customer service #nomoreaggravation
@JetBlue Gerne :)
@united  what did you do with my seat. International connection. Seriously?
@united what a pointless tweet. At least @AmericanAir asked me to follow them to try and resolve
@united Tell me that you're at least going to cover a room and get me out of here.
@JetBlue dropping passengers with small baby and 3 infants at your San Juan terminal. As unloading baby, officer writes me ticket for $75
@VirginAmerica The Flight Booking Problems section of your website seems to be broken on Chrome. Might wanna look into that.
@JetBlue Social Media Takes Flight with Fly #LikeAGirl - What brand lesson can we learn?  #SMM #Brand  https://t.co/nTGl2WnQVM
@usairways That is appreciated.  However, the system tells you call back Late Flightr then ends the call.  No need to reply, thanks.
@united nope I gave up - maybe they'll deliver it
@united Found flight after 2.5 hrs. How am I offered a $200 flight voucher 12 hrs before, lose my seat out of neglect, then get nothing?
@SouthwestAir promised 4 rooms until Wednesday, (wentook3) and the hotel charged us $79 per room because we had a pink paper needed white?
@SouthwestAir do you not try to get customers to their destinations? No help to get on another airline if you had no flights for 3 days?
@united and most frustratingly, all this delay happened either at the gate, or even onboard the aircraft! No heads up in advance!!!
@united in addition, my first flight was delayed an hour and I'm arriving at my destination 8 hrs Late Flight.
@AmericanAir is flight 1318 Cancelled Flighted or not? No word from the ground staff.
@SouthwestAir always when I fly SW. #loyalRRmember
@SouthwestAir BTW I was completely unable to buy wifi for my flight using Galaxy S4. Couldn't zoom out or scroll to touch "Buy"
@united @FernHeinig18 your delay is due to your own making. We have now been back to the gate multiple times. Maybe take accountability
@VirginAmerica my drivers license is expired by a little over a month. Can I fly Friday morning using my expired license?
@USAirways will I get the full amount credited to my account for US Airways credit?
@united Thank you for responding so promptly! I look forward to the 240 kms drive to the office to file a claim.
@USAirways been on hold way to long!  Is this the best level of service you can provide? - one hour+ is too long!
@USAirways thanks for seating me next to 2 hot athletes. This flight is significantly better now!
@AmericanAir Sitting at the gate on Flight 719 for an hour due to Sabre being down. What backup plan is in place if Sabre cannot be fixed?

@united thank you! üòä
@USAirways @AmericanAir at 9:05am after the plane left: "why were there no agents and why were the doors closed so early?"
@SouthwestAir I will say that your customer service has consistently been the very best!!!
@SouthwestAir too Late Flight now
@SouthwestAir bumped me to preboard on both flights (because I'm fat?) Whatever the reason, thanks!
@JetBlue I will! Thank you!
@SouthwestAir Thank you for your time!
@JetBlue What is going on with the flight from Buffalo to JFK? Have they figured anything out about the temperature and the tower yet?
@JetBlue Thank you. I really would have preferred Jet Blue. You guys have the best seats in the business.
@united according to your DMs, I'm not owed a refund. please may I be provided with a contact number before I go to my bank to file claim
@USAirways why the hell u left *alliance and joined 1world is beyond me not a smart move time to start looking at other carriers
@USAirways thanks for making me miss my meeting in Dallas. 700 dollars down the toilet üòä
@USAirways can I check bags through to my final destination even though I bought separate tickets from IAD to PHL  and PHL to Israel?
@VirginAmerica Is it me, or is your website down?  BTW, your new website isn't a great user experience.  Time for another redesign.
@SouthwestAir waiting over a half hour for my checked baggage to be delivered! No updates from any ground crew
@united Will the airline refuse my Canadian passport with less than 6 months remaining validity? Going to US.
@united It was Cancelled Flightled, none of the passengers were notified. Complete violation of travelers' rights.  @AerocivilCol
@SouthwestAir my question is this: what's up with the crazy boarding procedure? Does the confusion prevent fistfights over the good seats?
@united - thanks for your help...got me what I need, but its an issue with @_austrian . I guess I sit awhile longer.
@united I tried but no one was available in bogota and everyone was rude in Houston. I was stuck for 35 hours because of you guys
@USAirways not best pleased with service so far. On our third gate and still no guarantee that it's the correct one :(
@AmericanAir thanks for forcing me to check -in my carry - on luggage. That is exactly why I spent extra money on "travel size" toiletries
@JetBlue thanks...
@united it should be free like other airlines! Again, it‚Äôs not 1997 anymore.
‚Äú@united: @Addair  We hope you don't miss your connection. For help with re-Flight Booking Problems please Follow us &amp; DM your confirmation. ^CP‚Äùdone thx
@USAirways was on hold for about 45 minutes after speaking 2 lady at the airport counter. Gave up
Never got to the strip that fast before. Stoked for special @Imaginedragons show tonight! Thx again @SouthwestAir! http://t.co/ToPqmVqnJp
@united I did already rebook, and now I will miss my first appointments in London tomorrow morning. Thanks for ruining my trip - AGAIN!
@united I need to talk with an actual person about missing luggage. Please advise on how to make that happen.
@southwestair so I saw the promo for A-List when I was on a plane this Monday. I fly two more times in the qualification period. 1/2
@united so who does handle bag issues? And why wouldn't you put me onto them in the first place?
‚Äú@SouthwestAir:Southwest mobile boarding passes now available in iOS Passbook! http://t.co/xmRvR4lGEg http://t.co/wJoc9f14SU‚Äù@tori_leggieri
@AmericanAir  oh no she left the counter and went downstairs.  Then she told Elise an agent that joined her not to come over to counter.
@SouthwestAir Any plans to make the southwest app for Android not crappy?
@JetBlue hi is there a way we can check to track the flight that will arrive &amp; that will be our flight to depart.
@united I'm a UA 1k. I think it's @iamtedking who was looking for help
@USAirways No, this is a systemic problem. Mail comes from 153.69.214.203 but USAirways SPF record disallows it. DM me for more detail
@USAirways How can I change without penalty and not have to call customer service
@VirginAmerica can you please get me to the new york area before monday afternoon
@USAirways understood. It simply feels as if the staff is not being entirely truthful about the situation.
@united @gg8929 Unbelievable hypocrisy!!
@united UA1130 Flight was a nightmare!! From poor customer service,having my confirmed seat given away.... +more issues
@SouthwestAir...give the crew of SWA 4007 a high five from this AV-8B guy for its nice XW landing into @bostonlogan. Nicely done!
@USAirways left us. had to stay on other flight until they got bags off. This sucks. Had to run with a baby and bags!
@JetBlue your customer service today was deplorable.  There were plenty of ways u could have gotten us on that flight. #badcustomerservice
@USAirways you gladly take the loyal customer's money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused.
@SouthwestAir @love_dragonss oh my gosh
@AmericanAir Is this a serious thread. Maybe you guys should re-read it. #fail
@USAirways my frustrations are the result of multiple experiences Late Flightly. Currently lost luggage. I want to talk to a real person.
@united There is no excuse for leaving a minor to spend the night sobbing (9 hours) in a plastic chair. UA's actions? Terrible. # united
@AmericanAir it doesn't allow me to hold. That's the problem.
@usairways I don't understand why I can't get my missing miles? I was on the flight, it was in my Dividend Miles Account‚Ä¶ #help
@USAirways US Airways website. So you double charge people when they book flights now? Apparently you have but I've never been booked twice
@SouthwestAir thanks for the quick response. Should I call daily it wait the 5 days.
@united I understand ppl make mistakes but don't code something in a way that we can't get reimbursed when it's YOUR fault. Just blatant LIE
@USAirways horrible cust service exp at DIA today. Wife waited 3 hrs on the plane b/f flight 695 was Cancelled Flightled. Still waiting for bags.
@JetBlue Done! Also looks like you opened some up on my flight to Vegas on Sunday! üíô
@AmericanAir not sure what this means but son and I will certainly have operational needs for seats during Flt. 1679 next Friday, yet...
@united Once again I am victim to the scam that is your SHIT Customer Service, this time the agent hung up on me WTF do you teach your staff
.@united Thanks. Hopefully this is easily resolved.
@united you suck. @SouthwestAir you're the best.
@united are my bags here yet?  They were at Palm Springs airport.  I was at LAX.  How come I beat my bags here.
@USAirways: I relied on US Airways, and that was my mistake. Awful customer experience.
@USAirways still waiting on a response
@VirginAmerica had to change to another airline to get to DC today ... Why is @united able to land in DC but not you? Cost me $800 ...ugh
@AmericanAir I've been in line for over half hour trying to see a representative, now I might even miss the next flight too, unacceptable
@USAirways but only for certain flights from CLT-NYC. The notion that you can't rebook customers for 48 hours is absurd.
@united your b737-800w  literally the smallest seats I have ever have, my dad got stuck In the tiny bathroom ad well #disspointed #premier1k
@AmericanAir Flight 2954, Dallas to Grand Junction #AmazingFlightCrew

@united please explain why I need to pay bag fees twice, equally $1200, because a delayed flight resulted in bags being rechecked overnight?
@United yall tried it with this little bitty plane flying out of boston!! I hate little planes!!!
@VirginAmerica Another delayed flight? #likingyoulessandless
@United appreciate the early arrival of UA1002, but any chance ORD will ever bring the bags out?
@AmericanAir got off the phone w/ rep now flight has disappeared. Locator IRRLCD she said I was rescheduled. Help please.
@JetBlue thanks for getting me to Orlando early #happiness
@VirginAmerica happy to spend the day together. Let's do this!
@united aisle please
@AmericanAir #AATeam thanks for working in very rigorous weather conditions for all
@AmericanAir any luck?
@JetBlue can you ask SLC checkin/bag drop if they found a dark blue/blackish fit bit flex? Would've lost it there around 445pm MT
@JetBlue how do we watch the oscars though right now?! No abc on flight :( #missingtheoscars
@united thanks, that would be awesome.
@AmericanAir Kudos to the crew of Flt 167 today. Specially to Carlton. Loved your new 767-300. Keep up the good work AA!
@SouthwestAir I urgently need two receipts sent but CS is closed. Can you help?
@USAirways your pple did a great job w the madness however some of your systems need help. I appreciate the hard work &amp; the push to b better
@SouthwestAir @Imaginedragons @beatsmusic well timed tweet, just boarded and will be listening on my way home!
@usairways I've been on hold since 11:30pm how many customer service reps do you have? #seriously
@AmericanAir  terrible response! How about someone picking up the phone and calling me...It is now 49 Hours with no luggage
@JetBlue Flight 136 departed Phoenix at 1:30 am
@SouthwestAir Yes. I figured an hour was a long enough time to hold before giving up. Can somebody call me?
@USAirways I was calling before I left, and as it turns out @united answered their phones instead and they rebooked my USAir flight.
@SouthwestAir is the contest over for Destination Dragons? I want to try to do everything I can to go.
@united That's not the issue. The fact that no one even called (despite promises) to confirm the bag's location is.
@united is doing musicians real dirty at LAX. I've never been blocked from getting on a flight with my bass.
@AmericanAir I changed my own flight to tonight. Why couldn't AA do that on my behalf instead of a flight tomorrow? Poor effort all around.
@JetBlue yes I do. I will get you exact data. Your download is fine it's your upload bandwidth and ping that are the issue. Ping especially
@JetBlue Has DC Thinking About Summer With New Nantucket Service - @MarketWatch http://t.co/yI4wGUk5tr
@USAirways since when does a maintenance problem and missing flight crew equal delayed due to weather? I'm confused since we had sunny skies
@AmericanAir The bad weather wasn't a surprise! You should have double/triple staff on hand to handle calls. Way to treat your customers.
@united but we are on All Nippon now (booked by United to replace the one we missed).
@SouthwestAir any spare tickets for Vegas? Would be forever grateful! #DestinationDragons
@JetBlue the whole plane. Hoping for better luck on the return flight Sunday.
@AmericanAir I am traveling from AUH to IAD via etihad and then from IAD to DFW via AA. Will I be able to retrieve my checked bag in IAD?
@JetBlue when will you release flights for February 2016?
@JetBlue Why not deal with that while the plane's on the ground instead of diverting the plane &amp; adding 2 hrs to the flight?
@united question:are there onboad 110 volt outlets in all planes? If so, where?
@USAirways but it's not their fault, because their policy says they at least got us to our destination. Really?
@VirginAmerica what is your policy on flying after surgery?
@AlbertBreer just so you know who to complain to ;-) RT @USAirways: Reminder: From 2/28, we‚Äôll be tweeting from @AmericanAir.
@USAirways @AmericanAir USAIR #703 has returned to PHL due to issues with the fire detectors. What happens next?
@VirginAmerica your site is tripping. I'm trying to check in and I'm getting the plain text version. I am reluctant to enter any card info.
@United OMG WHERE IS MY BAG??? YYZUA70435 - enough with the shenanigans already. It's getting real old real quick!!
@USAirways I just got hanged up on trying to get to an agent. Can you help?
@USAirways #FAILINGYOURCUSTOMER ONE BY ONE
@AmericanAir how about a reservation phone system that actually works? You know the 800 number is unreachable? Callbacks are "dead air".
@VirginAmerica moved my seat with no notice. "Better seat" is cabin select not behind the row I selectedüëé #DISAPPOINTED
@united S/O to @Delta for coming in clutch and finally taking me home üôåüôå
@AmericanAir #horriblecustomerservice # rudestaff # incompetentmanagers
@united you've got to be kidding me. I still haven't talked to a human and your robotweeting me?! And asking for a follow????
@AmericanAir .....and they waited 5 hours in a stuffy plane until they could get off then 7 more hrs to get their luggage  #AmericanAirlines
@JetBlue they tried to have us towed. Do you think I'll be flying out of your terminal again? Risk of $75 fine from corrupt police official
@SouthwestAir it's never too Late Flight to do the right thing
@united I was just calling the Global Services help desk so via phone.
@USAirways this is got to be the worst service I've ever seen with an airline. 3 Cancelled Flightled flights. Rude employees. Currently flight delayed
@USAirways so mad I can't even believe  you guys Cancelled Flight my connecting flight after I leave the first stop, &amp; give me a useless hotel voucher
@USAirways but question :  if the downgrade include losing first class do you get money back ? http://t.co/LfT7QD23Sy
@United no consistency, #Denver agents say no standby with checked baggage citing FAA. Your website policy says otherwise. #time2switch
@united thats weak. See ya üëãHey @VirginAmerica !!
@united @44Stocker my wife Sarah stocker did also called but could not connect me to customer service
@united most terrible flight experience happening to everyone right now on Flight:UA1750 6 delays 4 hrs total missed all my flights now thnx
@JetBlue Says #Lufthansa Incentive Offer To Have No Impact On Share Count - Nasdaq http://t.co/VU7XSWJKiY
@AmericanAir @nickcunningham1 Except now there is no wait time, the phone system just hangs up on you. So continuing to hold won't help.
@JetBlue no more than half an hour wait. It's unreal. Finally first bag coming out. SJU needs to work on this
@USAirways thank you for fixing my 5 hour delay.
@SouthwestAir I cannot DM you as you do not follow me.
@united I will give it a couple more weeks. Thank you.
@USAirways and now you can't even accommodate us by letting us fly in to another airport?! Horrible service for your fault!!!
@USAirways we've (flight 4443) been sitting on the tarmac of dca for a while now waiting on a gate. Can we just use another gate?
@united I paid for economy plus and you put me in the last boarding group so I have to gate check my bags too? @VirginAmerica knows better..
@USAirways skys r sunny air is cold I can't wait to get to #CLT
@AmericanAir I have got a flight forThe next day !! What about a credit ! You guys are a multimillion dollar company give us back a Credit
@AmericanAir its now 17 days since I contacted customer relations... #surf #fail #BaggageDrama http://t.co/CS1673hrqQ
@SouthwestAir there's a current Cancelled Flightlation in Indianapolis, my girlfriend is stranded. Any ideas, or help you can provide?
@USAirways how long are you going make us sit in this plane while they repair it? Could I at least get a beer???
@AmericanAir 3611 was supposed to depart at 5:10pm central.  About ready to close the door at 7:34pm central.
@united The only thing you fella have done right today is get me to the pacific time zone.
@SouthwestAir No like I said I could not reach anyone at your company so I had to rent a car and chalk the whole thing up to a loss
@USAirways "good news. We've located the crew and made contact with them". flight was supposed to leave 4 minutes ago. #usairwaysfail
@JetBlue why are we delayed :( flight 1601
@USAirways  Lilly M in SJU check in is fabulous!
@AmericanAir Is there a way I can get a record of all the flights I've taken with you?
@SouthwestAir We have been waiting for almost 3 hours trying to rebook flights. PLEASE help us get through to someone.
@united once again my bag is lost when I travel united!!!! Please do something
@united you're missin the point! There was no "weather". You're lying! Seats was broken. But u claim "weather" to get out of hotels. Classy
@SouthwestAir sign me up!
@USAirways absolutely
@VirginAmerica trying to book a flight &amp; your site is down üòÅ
That would be great! I never thought I'd be the sort who'd be into them, but it really makes the flying experience more bearable @JetBlue
@AmericanAir I got rebooked on on us airways by you guys but the flight I got won't work. Any help would be appreciated.
@USAirways im on the plane not sure what you mean. We are sitting here. It's just one story of failure after another when I fly you guys
@USAirways what is the baggage allowance on flights from Glasgow to the US?  Thanks
@USAirways is utterly unreliable! They didn't schedule a pilot for their US624 flight out of Seattle - flights are delayed #usairwaysfail
@united in ORD hotel issued to my 4yr old. Tickets needed fixing again another hour and 5 agents l8r nightmare still not over
@AmericanAir still not taking calls ?   Storm ended 2 days ago. Be like pats and #doyourjob
@SouthwestAir Customer relations line had busy signal too, called the normal line and the service rep thought I was dumb for not knowing.
@USAirways Decided to be a good sport and give you guys another shot. Flight delayed. Again.
@JetBlue Why wasn't a $15 service credit voucher I received for tv not working accepted on my next flight for a pillow?
@VirginAmerica why Cancelled Flight flight VX413? One sec its delayed, on my to airport, the next its Cancelled Flightled?Gonna email or call me to reschedule?
@JetBlue Perhaps you need to start recruiting @msbgu ;)
@SouthwestAir Flying now from JAX to DEN and I paid $8 for wifi that barely is functional.  Couldn't do work if I wanted to.  Never again.
@united I need assistance. Due to your incompetence I need to reschedule a connection. I will NEVER fly @United again.
@SouthwestAir you only hear about the bad things. Flying the last to weekends, the flights and crews were awesome. Thank you. üëçüëç
@AmericanAir 140 characters aren't enough to describe how inconsiderate your employees are
@USAirways a member of your staff at PHL just gave us excellent customer care. Shame the same couldn't be said for the past 24 hours.
@AmericanAir we've been on hold for hours.
@united, American never had my bags apparently. United never switched them over. Had to go back to United Baggage Service.
@united flight 435
@AmericanAir I really wanted to sign up for your airline credit card but your absurd $400 change fee to switch my flight made me think twice
@SouthwestAir Thanks!!! :)  It is good to air on the side of caution
@USAirways Why can't I check in online for a flight tomorrow am?
@AmericanAir I would like a refund for this flight. They delayed the flight 5 times. I feel like you're making fun of us.
@JetBlue its domestic I just wanted more of an idea so I don't get surprised.
@USAirways and if the flight is full?
@SouthwestAir Congratulations!
@JetBlue Yeah I have! I'm on it!! Looking for specific dates - I will just keep checking daily for a fare drop
@AmericanAir is there any way to manually add gift cards to an ex-EU ticket( AA metal on long haul,BA for intra-EU)?
@SouthwestAir had to Cancelled Flight my flight because my Cavalli calves was interfering with the onboard equipment.
@united I shouldn't have to spend my own $$$ on a hotel because of a weather delay. The weather being something COMPLETELY OUT OF MY CONTROL
@AmericanAir what is going on with the flight 2417? It has been delay a lot .
@VirginAmerica first time flying you all. do you have a different rate/policy for media Bags? Thanks
@VirginAmerica is flight 882 Cancelled Flightled and what do I do if it is?
@united I have flights that don't appear to have been applied to my MileagePlus account. Can you help?
@USAirways It's very difficult to work with Baggage claims when they don't answer the phone
@AmericanAir after several miss communications I was able to get to ORD but I am not home yet and not sure I will get there due to her error
@united thank you. I will address it with them
@united captain "on behalf of the front office, welcome on board.".... Never heard that before. I laughed...hard.  #funnycaptain
@united idea: if u don't want us to be frustrated don't Cancelled Flight flights because your crew overflowed a toilet. Get a plumber
@united makes total sense, except flight wasn't full :) I've got empty seats around me &amp; overheads were more than half open when I boarded.
@southwestair after 4 hours of delays you did make a nice offer for rescheduling me the next day... but...
@AmericanAir Need to change flight, but the CS # is telling me it can't take my call. Can't change online. Please help. Flight is this week.
@united we're still waiting to find out your rep is working hard - most upset about having to wait to tomorrow pm to get to mammoth
@SouthwestAir truly the best in #customerservice.  If something goes wrong, no matter how big or small the issue was, they fix it. Thank you
@SouthwestAir Yes - with extra $77. I wonder what are you going yo loose, if there is room.
@SouthwestAir You need to be more accommodating to your loyal customers. Not happy now!
@united sent DM's
@SouthwestAir Thanks! Sent a DM to you. Let me know if oyu need any additional information.
@USAirways First class service on US 769 PHL-MCO today from the flight attendant in F. I didn't catch her name but she was top notch!
@JetBlue send more service agents so all the stranded passengers can be helped!!!üÜòüÜòüÜòüÜòüÜòüÜòüÜòüÜòüÜòüÜòüÜòüÜòüÜòüÜò
@united Charging $6500 for biz flight to UK = somewhat egregious. Charging $3 on top for a Sam Adams draft at the United Club is usurious.
@AmericanAir Well, you guys are totally kicking a million pounds of ass. Bar none, the best SM team in the airline industry in my opinion.
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/BBM6PAbORt‚Äù &lt;&lt;Now THAT is fuckin funny. üòÇ
@united I was not looking for the fare to be returned on the companion flight.  don't understand why an additional $200 fee was necessary.
@USAirways Feeling helpless at Tanpa airport. How can I talk to someone. Flight delayed 4 times. Need help. Missed connections will be prob
@united I took care of it myself. Had to rent a car and drive 3 hours to retrieve my belongings. Due to united errors.
@united I bet @SouthwestAir doesn't turn a thirty minute delay on an original flight into a 7+ hour delayed arrive time
@AmericanAir my flight was Cancelled Flightled, leaving tomorrow morning. Auto rebooked for a Tuesday night flight but need to arrive Monday.
@united The so below skilled staff and inadequate system just deleted my return from Houston to Norway. Shoulder shrugging is all you do..
@united stellar customer service. You have earned my business by your attention to detail.
@AmericanAir why would I pay $200 to reactivate my points that are only useful for certain flights that aren't even worth $200?
@united giving up on your direct flight from IAH to Honolulu. 3rd attempt in 3 years - 3rd delay.  $7 meal voucher. Wow. Customer service!
@USAirways you suck and you ruined my day. And my vacation isn't even until June.
@USAirways I've done everything. Still no luck in finding my bag. I don't understand how my bag could have been misplaced. Very upsetting.
@united flight to DFW from IAD Cancelled Flightled for mechanical can I get rental car to MDT-my origin
@united your airline is the biggest joke of an operation in the world.
@SouthwestAir when and why was flight 4471 from MSP Cancelled Flighted this AM?
@united your plane's been waiting at the Gate for two hours with all passengers onboard in their cramped seats. Yuck.
@JetBlue bag just delivered and items have been stolen.  At first look - my Kate spade bag and bottle of spiced rum!  Wtf!!
@JetBlue my son left his iPad on flight 1401 from JFK to FLL on Monday. I called and left message and have no heard back. Seat 25A.
@SouthwestAir fyi the link in your baggage incident email redirects to a 404 on mobile. The link auto changes on mobile. Desktop works fine.
@AmericanAir absolute terrible service to schedule a 40 minute layover and then not let someone on the plane with the door not closed.
@united If someone misses his connecting flight because of the airline, and it was the last flight of the day, how will you fix it?
@united @MaxAbrahms *if* he needs assistance? Do you expect him to go on a Scooby Doo tour of terminals until he finds his stuff?
@United lounge @ #Heathrow Used by @AirNZUSA http://t.co/6hJucP694l
@USAirways if one with @AmericanAir why can't you use American miles????
@JetBlue whats going on with flight 2034.  Delayed beyond 834.  Shouldnt thre flights switch at that point?
@USAirways if it was so important, why did I wait on hold and then get hung up on by your computer?  #disappointed
@USAirways Thank you glad to be home. There were lots of delays with the plane and flight crew didn't show up. It was very frustrating.
@USAirways any guesstimate on hold times? Can't change my flight online, at 45 mins and counting...
@JetBlue Awww man...but I need to buy this ticket today and be home the 1st of MarchWhere do I go for this...or can you assist me ?
talked to a @JetBlue manager and she offered we pay 3X's in cash what we originally paid #nothanks #jetblue #ripoff #flyunited
@united No thanks.  Took care of it when I called
@VirginAmerica Do you provide complimentary upgrades to first class, if there are available seats?
@USAirways finally rectified my flight situation! Thanks again
@JetBlue keeps asking me to enter a valid email address. My info is saved and has worked hundreds of times before
@AmericanAir Took a flight yesterday fron TPA-DFW-AUS. Bag went to IAH. Today bag went to IAH-DFW and then back to IAH. Still no bag!
@united alright thank you. Much appreciated.
@JetBlue, my dads vacation to SXM got delayed a day because of @AmericanAir shoddy service. Earliest FLL &gt; SXM flight? trying to hep him out
@USAirways flight #654 sitting at JFK with delays for 3-1/2 hrs! No employees to load bags? #terrible
@AmericanAir back in UK now no thanks to your staff that wouldn't me or the other passengers stranded. Just laughed at us
@SouthwestAir any idea on flights to Nashville tomorrow being clear or Cancelled Flightled
@JetBlue I clear that folder regularly and JetBlue is white listed so it never got to me.
@united you may think I'm joking or blowing it out of proportion but the last 8 united flights have been delayed or significantly Late Flight.
@USAirways can you help chairman? I am on flight 686 PHX connect 599 SJC will miss connection can you reroute please.
@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine well deserved!

@united Where are my bags!!!  They weren't in LAX like your promised.  9 out of 10 things today were a mess today because of you.
@AmericanAir "sorry you were disappointed" #outoftouchwithreality #people have kids and jobs
@SouthwestAir very frustrated. Bought early bird at 6:30am on day tickets were released and got mid-B ticket. Spend $50 for nothing
@united on a 4 seg flt yvr to zurich, why would you credit all miles and but only 2 segs on full fare?
@SouthwestAir now I can't board thanks. You guys moved me to standby. I've been holding this boarding pass since 7pm yesterday
@JetBlue got txt  40min after sched dpt, saying plane had just arrived @ JFK. Late Flightr txt w/ dpt gate change. Then 9:04 dpt for 7:40 flight.
@AmericanAir I need to speak to a REAL PERSON. My flight was Cancelled Flightled with no explanation, and I've been on hold for more than 3 hours.
.@united we rebooked. But @casleah and I had to split up and take different flights because a pilot ran out of hours? Frustrating.
@united this customer service experience will be tweeted for quality assurance.
@united or how about next time my bag is underweight you guys credit me $200. Or how about I take my business to an airline that cares.
@USAirways so apparently all of your computers crashed at BWI?  Any update on when flights will be moving?
@United is officially the worst, most delayed, and least helpful airline I have ever had the misfortune of flying on
‚Äú@united: @leigh_emery We don't like to hear this. Is there anything we can help with? Thanks. ^EY‚Äù another empty offer for help.
@SouthwestAir there's an hour wait here for reFlight Booking Problems in line at Omaha.
@JetBlue I just DM'd you!
@USAirways what's your pet policy?
@USAirways nope not yet...
@USAirways your saving grace was our flight attendant Dallas who was amazing. wish he would transfer to Delta where I would see him again
@united hard to believe since your staff @ SFO checked them under someone by the name of #ritacomo who flew to EWR the same day.
@JetBlue what's going on with flight 669 and how many free trips will I get from this epic inconvenience @anku http://t.co/pEUc0BMij9
.@JetBlue this is enough for me to stop flying JetBlue.
@united its not the way to treat your customers we had a lot of issues and it was not worth our headache we went thru
@JetBlue remember - I'm very doubtful and not very hopeful :(
@AmericanAir missing a full days of work thanks guys
@USAirways @AmericanAir how does a pilot forget log book? Been waiting on plane for 45 mins!! #AlsoNoDrinkCartComingAround
@united When are you coming back to @IFlyOAKland? You have a huge East Bay customer base due to SFO and *I* miss you!
@united fantastic night of waiting 3 hours for a delayed airplane, only for you to alert us flight is Cancelled Flighted when it lands. #whatstatus
@JetBlue lipstick on a pig still a pig. Ur new baggage claim @ SJU is a disaster. No chairs, 20 mins+ wait for baggage. #fail
@USAirways got rebooked. Sent to A9. Wrong gate! Traveled back to B13 for correct flight. #tired&amp;frustrated
@JetBlue 108 to Portland Maine
@united it can't be delivered. It has to be held there for me to cross the border to pick up. Please don't try to deliver.
@united DM sent. Thanks so much for the strong customer service!!
@SouthwestAir love bridesmaid dancing Can't wait for you to fly into puerto Vallarta and kick united ass!
@JetBlue Hi there, any rough idea of when January 2016 flights will be made available?
@united nice to know that 3 hours of my time is worth $7.99. Free DirectTV for everyone! Ever hear of preventative maintenance?
@USAirways never let's me down, every. Single. Flight. Gets delayed.
@AmericanAir husband &amp; I complain about same flight. He gets voucher, I get nothing. Because he flew biz!? Who do I email about this?
@united I already follow you. One of you 800-number agents rebooked me. Went from a 777 to an a320. Ugh.
@JetBlue it's poop and barely works
@united A 3rd party service you use to sell your tickets has ripped me off. Excellent service United is offering.
@united Hey so many time changes for UA 1534. We going tonight or what? MIA - EWR
@JetBlue sale please soon?? I need a tan
@united "most likely" makes it sound like you have no idea, which is not how I want my flights to be. Please use facts thanks.

@USAirways really???  NOT ONE OF THEM CAN BOOK DIVIDEND MILES TRAVEL - Literally on hold now since 9:50pm - it's 11:30pm #NoExcuses
üòï RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/4KH92mKoTZ
@USAirways you're killing me sche a flight to board 3 min after mine arrived with gate on other side of airport #genious
@USAirways status shows "delayed" it was just "waiting for takeoff" so did it depart? It certainly didn't at 4:17pm. http://t.co/emRUbu4WzD
@USAirways &gt;250k miles on usair.  Last four flights not good. Other airlines much improved. Billing issues, seats, legroom, in air service.
@JetBlue Tried...considerable confusion...no announcement...no sign updates
@united what gate is ua5396 leaving from?
@SouthwestAir can't update my flight online bc it's been Cancelled Flighted twice already. Going on hour 2 on hold.
@SouthwestAir hilarious flight attendants on Vegas to Detroit tonight http://t.co/nw7vx7DGMF
@united well this one missed the mark.  She was in a snit from the minute I stepped up to the counter
@united 2nd Late Flight flight today
@united b) I contacted you directly, and the phone service was Laissez Faire at best.  The problem isn't a Cancelled Flightled a flight.
@JetBlue can you DM?
@united Gate Agent Alavera is amazing
@USAirways YOU ARE AMAZING!!! YOU ARE THE BEST!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE AND I FOLLOW YOU BACK;)üôèüôèüôè‚úåÔ∏èüòâ)

@USAirways - No live person to speak with all day at Dividend Miles, after they wrongfully took over 65,000 miles out of my account.
@SouthwestAir do you ever reinstate Cancelled Flighted flights?
. @united 5 hours, 3 gates, and 3 planes Late Flightr still not an update, explanation, or apology to be had. #WorstAirlineEver #UnitedAirlines
@AmericanAir - So does that mean your other flights going into Buffalo from other locations, you don't care about their safety?
@USAirways I've called to resolve my dividend miles issue for a week to no avail.  Please advise ASAP.
@USAirways Thanks for calling me about my 10:00p redirected flight at 10:07p. #SmoothOperation
@AmericanAir will award me 50,000 air miles!!! Yes I am going to take a vacation! #thanksamericanairlines
@AmericanAir I need some help. My record locator is bringing up TWO different flights in your system. One op by AA &amp; one from US Airways.
@united I see you guys are at it again. Amazing how one company continually makes mistakes yet fails to be held accountable for their error
@united Surprised to go from 1K last year to nothing this year. What happened to the "soft landing" policy of no more than 1 level?
@JetBlue Does your home airport not count in the badge system? My TB account says 2 flights but I've taken 3 this year.
@SouthwestAir yes. Thank you. Oct 25-oct 31
@southwestair your attendants at the ATL airport are awesome! Very helpful with all the Cancelled Flightlations this morning.
@VirginAmerica Debbie Baldwin gave a #rockstar performance of the safety demo this evening on VX919 #LAS2SFO #BestCrew #SheRocks
@SouthwestAir tried to enter that rapid rewards contest link on facebook but all my browsers kept popping up security warnings 4 it.
@SouthwestAir wifi on my plane but I gotta pay for it? Help your broke homegirl out‚úàÔ∏èüì±
@JetBlue you stood me up last night, but I'm giving you a second chance. I'm just a boy, tweeting an airline, asking them to fly him home.
@SouthwestAir poor performance all around! Paid for Express checkin weeks ago and can't even leverage it #bullshit
@united really fucked my day up Hilo to LAX 2hr30min delay because of software? missed connection, getting home 8hrs Late Flightr no upgrade nothin
@united past
@united the passengers waited inside the flight on the runway and returned back in o gate that should not count as a valid journey
@AmericanAir over 70 days  no contact from a human or apology letter. @AmericanAir is #yucki. Read all about it soon http://t.co/9R9OmzQAVI
@united aaaand 7 hours Late Flightr won't be catching a flight til 6AM...stuck in at airport in a snowstorm with no hotel-how's that for patience?
@united last week we also had maintenance issues and a flat tire. Another flight last week was Cancelled Flighted. Your track record is the WORST!
@JetBlue Flight 1562 had a 4 1/2 hour weather delay, but what is the 45 minute delay in getting bags to tired passengers?
‚Äú@JetBlue: @sylvie75015 Good morning, Sylvie! Have a great flight! #yourock‚Äù &gt; Thank you #JetBlue! @mxo42 @henrikwagner73 #JetBlueRocks

@united no bag tagging, led to many people backing up the aisle to front with bags

@AmericanAir Your response has been incredible. Truly amazed at the steps you have taken to enhance your customer relations. Big thank you üòÑ

@AmericanAir Trying to rebook a flight with you because of Cancelled Flightlation is a nightmare.  I was hung up on once. Can you help me rebook?
@AmericanAir @louprice13 @aacustomerservice. Apology not good enough. 4 planes with mechanical and 9 hours delayed unacceptable.
@AmericanAir Is there a way to add my AA number to an itinerary that doesn't involve sitting on hold for 1.5 hours?
@united Great, thank you!
@SouthwestAir used to love you, but you keep rescheduling my flights.  #southworst
@united how on earth could you close the united club in Atlanta? What a major #fail at an airport of this size
@SouthwestAir it's just the principle - it's hard to get mugged &amp; not be upset you took my money &amp; didn't give me anything #wrongiswrong
@USAirways Why haven't you issued a travel advisory for Charlotte Wednesday night and Thursday? 4-6 inches of snow.
@USAirways now in a black hole of your phone system
@USAirways Can you tell me why I waited 90 mins and then was charged the $25 phone change fee even tho I wasn't allow to make change online?
@JetBlue appreciate what you've done on your end to make this right, but still unhappy with initial incident. Will be calling.
@SouthwestAir Yes! I did and the bags came straight to my hotel. Thank you ...you guys rock!
@USAirways big thanks to Yvonne Anthony from the Chairman's desk.  Top tier customer service today.  #outstanding #service &amp; #support.
@JetBlue you're welcome üëçüëçüëç http://t.co/67k4N9eQ6E
@JetBlue Clients got ZERO, in 32 years career never thought this was possible.2 suitcases worth thousands of $$ in Italian clothing robbed.
@SouthwestAir Awesome staff at the  check in desk! They had a paper airplane race for a SW gift card to keep ppl entertained during delays
@JetBlue are we scheduled to depart as scheduled?
@USAirways And, the helpful employee who changed her boarding zone so that she would have space for her pump is now being disciplined #fail
@AmericanAir And gold status too.
@SouthwestAir Thanks for taking care of me Today!  Michele rocked the customer service! Gate 25 HOU
@AmericanAir I'm at the airport right now and your people didn't know how to react and help me with this situation. Very frustrated.
@JetBlue If this is customer service, then please call me.
@AmericanAir my flight was Cancelled Flightled yesterday early afternoon, so why did you call me at 1230am and 230am to wake me up and tell me?!
@AmericanAir to realize your customer service leaves much to be desired and the folks handling the calls could care less...and it shows.
@JetBlue yes! Terra blue chips were my favorite. :)
@united how much does a ski bag cost to check?  Bag contains 1 pair is skis and one pair of poles
@SouthwestAir wifi is so slow! What is the point having one if can't get on the Internet?! Ugh...
@AmericanAir you set a schedule try and keep it !!! #AAALWAYSLate Flight
@united This is with regard to a flight from a couple weeks ago. I'm very frustrated with your policies &amp; expressing that.
@SouthwestAir thank you!!
@JetBlue my butt hurts.
@SouthwestAir 9 hours at this airport and you can't move a bag from one plane to another! #furious
@SouthwestAir just do it that easy
@VirginAmerica I requested a mileage challenge for status several weeks ago online but haven't heard back. How do I get help with this?
@united loses my luggage and @hotelstonight loses my reservation. after a 10 hour travel day. I just want to get to @StartingBloc in the am!
@SouthwestAir Just watched crew on flight 380 help elderly lady off plane...#firstclass
@JetBlue #1691 out of JFK. no one has info &amp; no answers as to why we boarded the plane. the team is in an awkward spot &amp; everyone is cranky
@USAirways Why is there no contact email for customer complaints?
@USAirways any updates on Flt 1848, here at the gate and they have no expected time of departure
@USAirways please have your people hold flight 599 from Phoenix to San Jose.  We pulling up to the gate! Scheduled to depart at 5:40
@AmericanAir at some point u need to tell passengers what is going on. At Jfk waiting to get on flight it is a mess.
@USAirways I expect something more than telling me to see an agent to rebook my flight...
@AmericanAir sure is. What's more frustrating is being stranded at the airport with our fate in your hands.
@USAirways Forget reservations. Thank you to the great leadership at your company, I've Cancelled Flighted my flight. Once again, thank you.
@USAirways How do I add my TSA Pre number to an existing reservation?
@united as a million miler with UA, and flying almost every week I observe gate and flight crews committed to good operations
@USAirways, if I rebook on another airline after my flight was Cancelled Flightled, do you reimburse? I need to get home today, not Tuesday.
@AmericanAir why is it most first class passengers now request the sand which from coach ?
@AmericanAir üôè in my hotel now. Thank you!
@united it sucks not having the money to book a flight to see the love of my life. 2600 miles away.
@united next time I will not volunteer to let you gate check my bag for space, since you obviously can't deliver it in a timely manner.
@JetBlue if you want to fly in a storm that's your right. But give us the choice. We have kids and don't want to chance it. #nixchangefees
@AmericanAir i've now been in France two days without changing clothes and nothing to keep me warm so please locate my bag and send it to(4)
@AmericanAir - Please find my bag!! In Singapore for three days already without my bag. Last known destination LAX Tag: 580815 Please help.
@VirginAmerica lost my luggage 4 days ago on flight VX 112 from LAX to IAD &amp; I'm calling every day, no response.Please give me back my stuff
@AmericanAir Unfortunately that is not true. A robot apologizes and hangs up. So how do I get help?
@USAirways hello??? Anyone there?
@AmericanAir have been waiting for a call back for over two hours jan to die tomorrow at 6am Cancelled Flightled what are my options?
@SouthwestAir I appreciate the response, but the constant changing of the flight time is frustrating to say the least. #toughtomakeplans
@united 1k use to be special.  80 people in group one.   Why not board global AND 1k together? http://t.co/qd2lyUXAZg
@USAirways we called and were able to get rescheduled. Thank you for the quick responses today!!
@united severely under staffed at Iah.
@USAirways the flight that I did not connect to was 1857.
@united Thank you for responding so quickly with a helpful tool! @dustyob
@USAirways yes, but we were answered and put back on hold while they were to check on our request..  50 mins Late Flightr nothing!
@united 8h flight without a working screen for me and my friend and not possible to move to another place #unitedfails#worsttripofmylife
@AmericanAir flt 703, sorry scheduled at 545, phl-mia, a totally chaotic, poorly addressed event.  Sent to three gates in the night
@united thanks for the 2hr delay and then no ground crew when we landed. At least you didn't break my http://t.co/GCWVFuopl2
@united check in and it's still saying I haven't paid. I've called back twice was on hold for 30 minutes then they answered and hung up. I
@SouthwestAir I have a voucher w swa that expires 4/10. An extension would be a lot of luv
@USAirways landed safely everything worked out.
@USAirways this travel day sucks but Malcome K at gate 39 rocks.  This guy is the brand you want to be. Replicate his approach and style.
@AmericanAir Now you've Cancelled Flightled my flight. First a priority ticket bumped and now this. You're losing customers. People are furious.
@SouthwestAir Paid for in flight wifi from Austin to San Diego - wasn't useable. :/ Possible to get a refund? Conf #8X7XVM
@SouthwestAir Didn't see travel had to be compete for unused funds by expiration date hidden in the fine print. Never saw that before.
@JetBlue thanks!
@united Thanks to Karen Salisbury at IAH for amazing customer service!  Found my daughter's bag lost on UA1516.  Made her day!
@united your "Airserv" contractors aren't worth a wet damn. 30min Late Flight, still not done w bags on UA1566. They made checkin a calamity.
@AmericanAir I didn't want to Cancelled Flight, I wanted to take someone off and keep my price. Held at 402, at 10am today 440, now 530
@USAirways I'm flying with you this Summer. Will I be able to leave Miami Airport during my 12 hour stopover there?
@AmericanAir um no just hanging out what‚Äôs new w you?
@SouthwestAir My bags are on the way to Chicago, without me! Help! I was confirmed for 2 flights and told there isn't room and I'm screwed.
@USAirways your people are kind and hardworking the infrastructure you have given them is horrid #massivefail #failphone #fail
@AmericanAir 30 minutes flight from OKC and then make us wait, 30 minutes cause the gate isn't empty.  #epicfail #poorplanning
@united, I'm still frustrated I gave up my seat &amp; the promised Travel Certificate was withheld w/o explanation. http://t.co/KvfwajVViD
@AmericanAir The pilot told us they would release bags as well as offer hotel vouchers. Neither happened.
@USAirways @AmericanAir taking off now. if I don't have a private jet to bora bora by the time I land, I'm calling Oprah
.@USAirways I did but the more eyes I have looking for Pandu the better chance I have of bringing him home.
@AmericanAir flights have been on time Late Flightly though!
@united the people at the counter have been very helpful. As you can see nobody is there. Flight to Austin 10:55 and still sitting here.
@united flight 433 lets go you look like clowns no one is giving up 1st class for $500
@united ROC flight Cancelled Flightled. Love my snowy drive home with no useful substitutes
@USAirways horrible experience to key west lost luggage called to check &amp; was told not to call back reconsidering my flight back
@AmericanAir unfriendly unhelpful agents. Unannounced gate changes. Delayed flight that we found out about by word of mouth
@united A3 Gold. So the international baggage limit apply when booked on 1 ticket,even for a domestic leg?  What if I travel with 2 friends?
@JetBlue @philpete wonder if that's the pilot tweeting you back? Is it legal to tweet and fly? What if the plane in front stops suddenly?
@AmericanAir the ticket is a poor gesture of goodwill (for missed trip) to a top status flyer - I may not next time (AA91 LHR-ORD 2/16)
@USAirways like they will call me? I'v been trying since yesterday and no one is answering...
@AmericanAir Flight 2559 it's been delayed every hour since 8:55 am.
@SouthwestAir Been sitting outside our gate for 30 mins at LGA. Why no move to another gate? We'e baking on this plane!?! flight #3415
@united I hope so but I've received no help so far. I've been on hold for more than an hour. Can someone speak to me?
@united where are our luggages? With a group and over 20 luggages are lost
@AmericanAir thank you! My lost item was located at ORD and is being returned to me.
@united yea get me to phoenix already. Delays all day with you people. It's bullshit.
@USAirways 4 hours... 4 hours... FOUR HOURS.  It's like this is a joke to you.
@VirginAmerica it's really aggressive to blast obnoxious "entertainment" in your guests' faces &amp; they have little recourse
@USAirways can I get free wifi since the flight 1808 was Cancelled Flightled?
@VirginAmerica @madbee95 check the website before you go to the airport!
@SouthwestAir Suggestions: tell customers approximate wait times when they are on hold (50 min now...) and allow them to Cancelled Flight online!
@JetBlue Gains Altitude, But SkyWest Hits Turbulence JBLU SKYW - Investor's Business Daily http://t.co/P2HUM7lXUR
@SouthwestAir would love Tix for Velour show-entered every contest and still haven't won :(
@SouthwestAir Another delay. Wow
@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine Love SW foreverüòÉüíïüòç‚§¥‚§¥
@VirginAmerica I didn't today... Must mean I need to take another trip!
@united JH, thanks so much for reaching out. I was able to get assistance after waiting for 70 minutes.
@SouthwestAir I also find it ridiculous that I've been tweeting to you since 3:50 AM EST and have still received no response. 9 hours?
@USAirways forced sections 4 and 5 to check their carry on. would have packed differently to check my bag. Why even allow it? #pissed
@united no apology? Cool.
@USAirways thanks !!!
@united how can you not know, after two hours of us sitting on the plane with no bags off loaded, the planes weight?!
@USAirways undermines the intelligence of customers by ignoring their complaints with their copy and paste canned responses #usairwaysfail
@united No, thanks. I'm sick of your company's lousy excuse for customer service. I'm never flying United again.
@SouthwestAir How do I stop getting credit card apps? I already have a card!
@USAirways Why is my "first available" flight for me now Tuesday but a flight today  that is "booked "#flt 755 available to buy online?
@VirginAmerica and it's a really big bad thing about it
@united even on international flight Glasgow to the U.S.? Then what about orlando to Newark? All 90 mins?
@united @DelonGerry ual sucks
@united Yes, though they have not located the bag yet. It was a lovely flight outside of that.
@SouthwestAir #DestinationDragons iD is my favorite band and i met my 2bestfriends thanks to them! it would be life changing to see them!
@americanair why am I not being given a callback option??! Why has this service been turned off?
@USAirways fight was delayed 3 hrs in MCO, now I'm stuck in Philly with a standby ticket, flight 4009. Solution needed.
@USAirways - Good to know that your phone customer service is still impaired due to "bad weather" that was over a week ago #jetblueanyone?
@JetBlue received horrible customer service at LAX on 2/11. Reservation Cancelled Flighted without notification, despite having confirmation number.
@USAirways yes, i am as well.  **FIVE** HOURS ON HOLD, FOLKS. Can you PLEASE tell me if this is typical?! Trying to be understanding here.
@SouthwestAir can you outline the policies for both scenarios?
@AmericanAir no space in my seat but thanks to your pilots I'm back 25mn early to Ohare!! Didn't think that was possible!! #sna2ord #1644
@VirginAmerica Thanks for your great customer service today &amp; for helping me get all my travel sorted out!
@SouthwestAir do these scavenger hunt  locations have anything in common because I'm playing detective trying to figure out the one for ATL.
@SouthwestAir DM sent. Thanks for the help!
@SouthwestAir you're right, I do. I've been traveling all day and you guys dropped the ball. Making for a long night.
@SouthwestAir Seriously? FOUR DELAYS? Only takes 42 minutes to get to Vegas from @flyLAXairport &amp; I have a connecting flight. #ridiculous
@united never again.
@USAirways @PHLAirport can you pm me w answer if flt to 4278 is still on time. Been on ground over an hr w no gate. Need help. Pls
@AmericanAir I put a call back in at 1AM and still nothing at 8AM. You think you might get back to me?
@AmericanAir help us here !!! We are stuck here @jfk for more than 24hours! !we need to go home #flight919 #saveus
@SouthwestAir why would I want to when the last time I did, you screwed me out of my early boarding that I PAID FOR.
@USAirways something is wrong with your phone system if you call someone and don't play the recorded flight notification. Is US643 Late Flight?
@united friends been sitting in Houston since 7am flight Cancelled Flighted.Still don't have any answers. #BadCustomerService  #$10voucherwhatajoke
@USAirways yup 1:34 minutes was my limit of waiting on hold so thanks for nothing
@united well that's big of you but I don't have terribly high expectations at this point.
@SouthwestAir how many left?! I'm 15 min wway
@united Left item n the seatback on UA1260. Is there any way to call DCA to ask if they have the item? Already submitted lost &amp; found report
@SouthwestAir if only you could control the weather in Las Vegas üòâ
@SouthwestAir My wife needs help. She is stranded in Chicago and can't get out until Monday. They won't find her bag because volume too high
@united well if you don't want your customers to be frustrated compensate them appropriately when you screw up royally!! #fakesincerity
@USAirways does anyone from your airline know how to do their job?
@united I will but right now I'm to angry
@USAirways So we got her home, now we just need her bag. Is there a direct desk number for Savannah?
@USAirways Can't get ahold of anyone to speak to about missing miles. It's been over a month since travel &amp; I've submitted twice online
@USAirways sitting for 30 minutes on the runway at dca, because your gates are full? Early landing, Late Flight flight.
@SouthwestAir Awwweesssooomee!

@SouthwestAir 3 hours and 80 degree difference. Yes please!!  MHT TO MCO @sadie4406 http://t.co/MRAW3qDw4D
@united never flying with you guys ever again. The customer service is piss poor at best.
@united I did, and as I thought, nothing happened
@VirginAmerica thank you! See y'all soon! I'm excited to see the expansion of destinations. Spread those wings!
@united thanks United I understand that. But he would actually like his own bag back! What have you done with it?! He also wants the money..
@SouthwestAir why the delay on Flight 423 BDL to MCO? Need to get to Florida for the ‚òÄÔ∏è&amp; races in Daytona
@AmericanAir my flight 386 to Dallas from Jacksonville fl has been Cancelled Flightled. No one has notified me. What's going on?
@united finally got through and they were very helpful. Appreciate it!
@AmericanAir thank you!
@USAirways is there a # or a time bracket I can call to fix this problem?I've been attempting to fix this contact information issue for days
@USAirways of course never again tho . Thanks for tweetin ur concern but not Doin anythin to fix what happened. I'll choose wiser next time
@VirginAmerica @ladygaga @carrieunderwood Julie Andrews first but Lady Gaga wow'd me last night. Carrie? Meh.
@united Hi JH, my experience with United has been entirely disgusting but yes, I'd like assistance in getting compensated for my bag.
@united -huge kudos to the FO of Sunday's flt #1623 sjo-iad. Handed my daughter her first pair of wings! Keeping traditions alive.
@VirginAmerica just landed in LAX, an hour after I should of been here. Your no Late Flight bag check is not business travel friendly #nomorevirgin
@AmericanAir Best planes in the business. NOT? AA5411 today. http://t.co/I7Vdi9WqSF
@VirginAmerica So excited for my first cross country flight LAX to MCO I've heard nothing but great things about Virgin America. #29DaysToGo
@AmericanAir it's not about the delay.  It's about the communication.
@SouthwestAir was in a line a mile long at sky harbor this morning. Your staff was courteous and expeditious.  Thank you. #onechildfourbags
@USAirways 45 minute delay for take off and 30 minute wait for checked bags? Really?
@SouthwestAir Looking forward to out Power of Inclusion event with very special guests! We will begin promptly at 11:30 a.m. #SWADiversity
@AmericanAir I need to go to YYZ tmr morning 8am. I switched to United already, but my bag is still off in AA la-la land.
@SouthwestAir now we have to wait, and wait to get it straight. I fly you for personal and business. But now, not so sure. #BeBetter
@united its been five days, I'm just asking you to clarify your policy on car seats. I don't want to have to take this higher up.
@JetBlue what can I say, I'm #LostinLove w/our #brandmance https://t.co/Bzwgp7aDVE #wemosaictogether #Mint #Love
@united have you inspected the picture? routine aircraft check while on his cell phone? What will the FAA &amp; NYT say ? http://t.co/bNgpli8JT6
Hey @USAirways based on the number of retweets and likes on my FB post, it's nice to know I'm not alone in my frustrations with you guys!
@SouthwestAir loving the new planes and the lighting, only wish windows were larger. http://t.co/h44uJ63CJG
@JetBlue I was returning from @FoodNetwork #SOBEWFF so I had limited carry on space in my tummy. Next flight I'll try that snack!
@SouthwestAir any particular reason it's 20+ minutes and counting to speak to a human being?
@united on a good note, the 2 employees I encountered @ Newark were fabulous. I was very Late Flight for my connecting flight and they got me on!!!
@JetBlue Thanks for taking me back home today despite Pandora's best efforts to Cancelled Flight the flight. #jetblue #backhome #noplacelikehome
@united here is the ticket # 0162424965446 please refund my unnecessary upgrade fee
@AmericanAir calling at 1am to tell me my flight has been rescheduled 12 hours Late Flightr than it was supposed be to seems like a bad solution
@AmericanAir arrived +-10pm eastern. Had to deplane on the CRJs airstairs to an icy Tarmac. Valet bags sent to carousel, so it was 10:20pm.
@SouthwestAir why was Southwest only airline to Cancelled Flight all flights from Charleston? Was 7:50pm flight Cancelled Flightation really weather reLate Flightd?
@SouthwestAir Bad enough that there is no seat assigned he's  seating at an exit seat and a male flight attendant removes him from there
@united Would be helpful if you could refresh boarding time info on boarding passes for delayed flights
@JetBlue is I can't make changes on the website am I still charged 25 dollars for using phone
@united yr team have me on hold for over an hour unhelpful Pls can you answer my question.
@SouthwestAir you guys should stop doing service in Denver it's horrible I get stuck here every time! I've been here almost 24hrs
@AmericanAir need help changing a flight. Please dm
@united Been sitting on flight 435 for an hour after landing in Newark. First no gate, then no jetway operator. Seriously!?
@SouthwestAir Never felt better taken care of! Indian aunties are the gold standard. Thanks Aruna! http://t.co/aypyaDUY6a
@USAirways ... What's going on at @PHLAirport ?!  I've been sitting at the gate for 45minutes.
@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flightled my flight, rescheduled to EWK gave me a pseudo-voucher that directed me to the worst @daysinn in existence. #fail
@SouthwestAir I start a new job tomorrow &amp; you Cancelled Flight my flight (1629 BWI-LAX) and you really can't get me on another flight today ?!
@USAirways trying to check in online for a flight tomorrow.  Tried computer, tablet, and phone.  got error message on all devices?
@AmericanAir Lost black wallet at #DallasAirport.I was on flight 2208 to CLE.Would appreciate ur help. Last I used it at @Starbucks on A20.
@SouthwestAir  I heard a rumor flight 898 was Cancelled Flightled.  Is this true?
@united That was the problem.  We were being told the aircraft was on its way.
@united Hi. My 2/23 flight from CUN-EWR shows a departure of 2:55pm on my United app.  Can you confirm?  Doesn't look correct.  Thanks.
@AmericanAir I can't!!!  No one can't get to "hold".  You can't get past the automated reply.  It hangs up on you.  #FRUSTRATED
@united what a joke. Hang up on customers!!
@SouthwestAir    How's life @ the NOC?
@JetBlue what is happening with the flight from FLL to SFO? Why the delay and the reroute?
@JetBlue by far the worst airline in terms of service at jfk.
.@AmericanAir I can't even get on the phone with your reservations team. The system automatically disconnects us.
@AmericanAir how about you give us a number to call instead of the empty email since you are not working on it
@SouthwestAir You completely let me down tonight. Your gate agents' ambivalence is just too much. How sad for you (&amp; me.)
@JetBlue it's been 3 hours, why have you not sent the plane from the hangar for flight 1533 at JFK? This is absolutely ridiculous.
@AmericanAir nah u boofin u dont talk like any humans i know. Respond like u actually have a brain. And again i dont want customer relations
@USAirways cardholder is flying.  We both have us airways and advantage cards which is more frustrating.
@USAirways that's incorrect. Four people, last flight of the night, with our bags. #horriblecustomerservice
@SouthwestAir reviewing your oversize policy. Hardcase golfbags are free if under weight. How do we add guitars and instruments to the list?
@USAirways   No one picks up the phone all day/  no opportunity to leave a voicemail
@SouthwestAir, real sincere apology! Makes my day! Glad to know flying mail is more important than me. Never flying SW again! #badservice
@JetBlue what's the link for #FlyFi
@USAirways i thought @united was the worst airline but nah. You guys are far worse. Is @Delta the only decent airline out there?
@SouthwestAir - our baggage motto: we don't cover that. Small tear, ripped seam, snow soaked, busted zippers - SORRY http://t.co/LHwFBKFynI
@united thanks! Everything a-ok now.
@SouthwestAir Thank you!  #thankful #feelingtheluv
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/PULp4i0w96‚Äù smh
@JetBlue just leave certain things to the kids.
@united Nearly 48 hours Late Flightr and still no idea where it is. I will never fly United again if I can help it.
@AmericanAir none of your sample itineraries can actually be booked http://t.co/mF7rABGn8a Every last leg back to US says invalid
@virginamerica not really the experience I was hoping 4, I ws forced 2 check in a small carry on, w/ nothing but empty cabin space on board
@JetBlue Well, I fly into Huntsville, AL. But I'd take either Nashville or Birmingham too!
@united We're hoping to hear from you actually.
@jetblue well, we're on our way now, but more than half my tv channels are just static. üòî
@united-rebooked to OMA - 180 miles from my destination. Spotty customer service. I get staff stressors but come on, this is your business.
@JetBlue just lost very loyal customers who use them 4-10 times a year.
@JetBlue App still saying I can't DM you...
@united I would appreciate an answer on why we weren't alerted flight had been Cancelled Flighted until plane landed.  #showsomerespect
@USAirways, I'm expecting 400% reimbursement for the unprofessional decisions with US728 on 21 Feb. Check your very full complaint box.
@JetBlue 1st flight of the morning, flying with a toddler. Will the plane be heated to a comfortable temp before boarding starts. #ItsCold
@AmericanAir Joanne from your San Diego staff was phenomenal! Give that girl a raise. She handled our #flightnightmare better than anyone.
@united that may be true however after 4 weeks matter is still unresolved and I can not get through to a supervisor or manager to help
@AmericanAir Thanx for replying. DM sent
@VirginAmerica I need you to follow back in order to DM.
@JetBlue is there wifi on he plain
@SouthwestAir unfortunately I don't even have that. My phone died before o had a chance to grab it. It was from OMA to SAN from 3/27-4/2
@united missing a day of vacation to see my husband because of this delay but stuff happens and I get that. Just wish it was handled better
@USAirways any plans to support #ApplePay on board? I have the USAirways MC and it would be nice to still use it if I forget the card.
@USAirways Your policy needs a serious revision for babies.  Fortunately I have choices and choose @Southwest from here on out.

@VirginAmerica thanks to your outstanding NYC-JFK crew who moved mountains to get me home to San Francisco tonight!
@AmericanAir Finally got a call from AA, but it was an automated voice that hung up on me! I called back &amp; it says it'll be 2 more hours.
@USAirways I'm glad @Beamske retweeted otherwise you would have to ignore the numerous tweets I sent. You all are fucking amazing
@united EVERYTIME I fly UR airline I hate you even more ! Thanks for the terrible service on flight 1071
@united one lady helping the 12 of us with luggage

@united thanks for the quick reply! I just fill in the form #idnumber8569822 #hopetogetanswersoon
@AmericanAir today, after 6 yrs., no longer my preferred airline.
@JetBlue - Fix your @#$&amp; jet bridges.  40 minute delay, 2nd gate...still waiting!  #jetblues http://t.co/ncB2oNcS9i
@united "the extra care airline". #unitedairlines they don't care. Trust me. There #customerservice is non existent. They don't have 1
@united very poor customer service. I WILL think again befor Flight Booking Problems another United flight.
@USAirways - have dinner reservations in a few minutes -- and I've been trying to get through to you since BREAKFAST. #onholdwith
@SouthwestAir horrible experience, passenger of size was 1/3 in my seat, offered $50 voucher for this by Christine C http://t.co/1xzrK66wVQ
@USAirways Darn it, first in line for no upgrade! Wish I understood the policy. :) http://t.co/xGPaAyFDwt
@united San Diego to Chicago. Leaving at 6:15 am tomorrow
i wish i was flying @USAirways ... @JetBlue Cancelled Flightled our flights tomorrow and never notified us #FlyUS #Ripoff
@AmericanAir Is it true, as FAs are saying, that you have no way to collect money from passengers (after door closing) who want a MCE seat?
@JetBlue if I had made as many mistakes as you in as short a period of time. I would I have lost my job at this point!!!
STOP. USING.THIS.WORD. IF. YOU'RE. A. COMPANY. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/Fd2TNYcTrB
@AmericanAir how realistic is it to make an 80 minute domestic to international transfer at JFK for a non US citizen?
@AmericanAir you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016
@united @rayja9 flying to las vegas out of Chicago flight is Late Flight and no announcement has been made
@AmericanAir i was spoken 2 like I'm an idiot and that is not OK!! I don't need to deal w/ that esp after the travel experience I've had
@JetBlue Thanks. Still booked our trip 3/13-17 LB to SLC to see grand kids.  Just very frustrating. Tried app, web, etc. Still love u guys!
@AmericanAir why is does it seem to be impossible to contact anyone at your airline to get an item left on board a plane 5 min after deplane
@AmericanAir Your customer service sucks! You rep should not be yelling at a caller regarding the weather in DFW.  Hope you go bankrupt!
@AmericanAir any idea on what the wait time is for refunds from @USAirways? I was told a few days over the phone - but it's well past that.
@USAirways wow this airline is a joke, absolutely horrendous customer service. you guys should be ashamed.
@VirginAmerica called your service line and was hung up on. This is awesome. #sarcasm
@AmericanAir yes but not with much help from you guys
@VirginAmerica they told to check with the airline regulation first so that is why I contacted you.
@JetBlue yeah that's all been done. Define "incidentals"? How much can I spend on gear so this trip is not a waste?
@SouthwestAir All I requested was a refund of my Reward Points that I used to purchase the flight and he refused.
@united So what do you offer now that my flight was Cancelled Flighted and I'm stranded away from home and work?
@SouthwestAir Looks like brooding skies out of ONT this evening. http://t.co/X9BLwgWA68
@united @perfectomobile I have to admit that not only the app is good but have lots of useful func (such the "live" seat map). Congrats
@united no I did not make connection.  Your stellar employee Vicky Thomas refused to board me even though 23 empty seats on plane
@united instead of Bourbon street how about #quiet #planes #SaveTheDiagonals
@SouthwestAir Kudos to bag handler at DTW gate 21 at 7:10 pm. Ran to keep bags from hitting ground in 9 degree temp! http://t.co/5tXU5tSFkJ
@AmericanAir no thanks.  As I said, being denied miles that expired one week ago was the last drop for me; plan to avoid AA as possible.
@united involuntarily bumped your passenger and can't guarantee them another flight for three days!
@JetBlue so why do you put this at the bottom of ur baggage report? For fun? #JetBlue @airlinequality #skytrax http://t.co/tU9JX2jaZN
@USAirways thanks for three Cancelled Flightled flight and making us go from raleigh to charlote to lexington to philly. istead of raleigh to philly
@SouthwestAir  how do you get one?
@JetBlue @MrJustyn I heard companies were studying popular lingo for advertising but this is just depressing and embarrassing.
@USAirways i tried it but doesnt help very much and Reservation seems to be overwhelmed with some issues
@JetBlue: So excited to hear about your move towards international travel from Long Beach Airport!
@USAirways Dude named Shaquille at the desk in Charlotte was incredibly professional and helpful vs. some crazy angry people tonight
@united thanks
@VirginAmerica, the only airline based in Silicon Valley! #disruption #FCmostinnovative #incubator  @FastCompany's http://t.co/wU3LbCNcr9
@southwestair excruciatingly slow internet on SWA flights is now the norm, rather than the exception. Is this being addressed?
@united and don't hope for me having a nicer flight some other time, try to do things right. You sold me those tickets with that connetion
@JetBlue I definitely will. Thanks!
@united thank you. I flew into Newark from Vail/Eagle.
@United says we had a weather delay in #YXE this morning. The "weather" didn't affect any other airline. #UA6136 http://t.co/4JdvK8tCqx
@united Terribly disappointed. Confirmed reservation delayed and your cust. service staff was not helpful in finding an alternate solution.
@united PTY to PIT via IAH
@JetBlue : ur Wed BWI-BOSTON flights (8pm) really need to be better scheduled! They are almost always delayed!
@AmericanAir  and I forgot about that lounge!üòÇ
@USAirways Seriously, flight delay Cinci to Philly due to new ground staff, miss connection to MAN UK and now have to argue for hotel. WTF
.@AmericanAir cover a rental car or refund our ticket? - I'll gladly drive 10 hrs home than be stuck here till Tues!
@AmericanAir thanks for getting back to me. how frequently are these weather advisories updated throughout the day?
@JetBlue what is a personal email that I can contact? I have a complaint that you should know about
@JetBlue You already Cancelled Flightled the one b4 us to DCA
@JetBlue keeps getting better. No water on the plane.
@SouthwestAir Trying to get through by phone to confirm that funds from a Cancelled Flightled reservation can still be used in the future. Can u help?
@united who do I need to contact regrading a complaint and to get a voucher funds for future travel on United?
@USAirways trying to Cancelled Flight a flight urgently...get hung up on twice??? Sweet refund policy
@AmericanAir @emxlyy "The wheel was broken when we got it. We swear."
@SouthwestAir love..luv the addition of the passbook option.
@united It isnt simple issue, generally how you set up check in/baggage policies at Logan and general unhelpfulness of employees in early AM
@united They inquire and then do nothing about it...pretend they‚Äôre interested. Responded to your DM and no response back...
@JetBlue works with Google #chrome but not Internet Explorer.
@united If you have had any issues with  United Airlines PLEASE retweet. Paid for a full fight ticket and was given a standby instead.
@united thanks for letting me sleep at DIA to ensure you ruin as much of my vacation as possible. Wait, no, fuck you. #unitedairlinessucks
@united its 2015 and no power outlets at the seats on a 6 hour flight to California? Seriously? This is why airlines are failing!! Pathetic!
@united boarding time shows 35 min and your gate agent started at 45. showed up at 4:00 and they had to check bag. http://t.co/zCBJyo6lsN
@SouthwestAir just DMed you guys!!! üòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
@united worried the cold weather or snow would delay us this morning, but no it was the pilots. #stillwaiting
@united are the ones who make it difficult for me.
@united thank you very much for the help. We're do I pick up my bags aspen airport &amp; are they coming in today on flight911
@JetBlue I know, but I wanted to pass it along. Not good for the "T5 experience" esp for someone who flies 2-3 times a month.
@united on a flight to New York! Love the quality planes on United!! #WTF #crappy #aviation #NewYork http://t.co/zv6CfPoHl5
@united I know I can see that too but now estimated time of dep. is 10am. I don't understand why there wasn't a better estimate 3 hrs ago
@JetBlue All correct for rates Boston to Pittsburgh wknd March 14? Rates all of a sudden took off! Made plans, came back to buy &amp; surprised.
@AmericanAir I sure hope you all can fix @USAirways. Good luck, their service sucks. #nexttimeiwillflysouthwest
@united I just sent an email to Customer Care, telling them I may have to break up with you üò¢. I sincerely hope they can help me!!
@USAirways Yes. Confirmation number and all.
@USAirways This is garbage, been trying to book a reward flight and then it got Cancelled Flighted and still can't get anyone on phone. Unacceptable
@JetBlue becomes first #airline to accept #Apple Pay - Future #Travel Experience http://t.co/czOr4nyh9n
@USAirways @garywerk poor excuse. I was towards front of plane, no sandwiches, we have to pay for them, should have more
@AmericanAir. It's been 5 hours and still no call and now we are back to being hung up on by an automated system.  #AmericanAirlines
@JetBlue Flight I want to book was $320 one day; went to purchase next day &amp; price doubled to $737. Inquiring on chance it may go down?
@united - Going on 3 days (tomorrow) and I still haven't received my bag from my flight to Toronto. Would love to see some seriousness here.
@SouthwestAir you need to get your act together. You new this morning at 830 our plane was malfunctioning. Yet I've been delayed 3 times ..
@united nice. I wonder how you pick who to respond to? Maybe only happy customers are easier. I wonder how many of those you have left.
@United Wanted to compliment ur phone agent Jeanette for reFlight Booking Problems RDU to SEA thru SFO after connecting flight thru EWR was Cancelled Flightled.
@united speaking of my flight, skateboards are allowed as carry on bagage right? No extra payment needed?
@SouthwestAir  I can go.  I want to badly!!!!   I don't know how to DM.  Can I e-mail you?   Help!!!  wmn4life@hotmail.com
@SouthwestAir rocks - @AmericanAir horror
@AmericanAir My connecting flight to DFW was Cancelled Flightled and need to get to IND tomorrow. Any way I can get this sorted out? Been holding 1h08
@AmericanAir Thank you for the info! Changes need to be made over the phone, correct? Is there any way an AA agent can call me directly?
@united she has crossed 4 prior times with other carriers and no issue. Karen was rude, untrained and unhelpful I also spoke
@AmericanAir I need to order a special meal and I can't reach AA. Been on hold for over 2 hours
@JetBlue three hours on s delayed flight staring a blank screen. At least a heads up so you could download a movie
@united I'll be calling soon but going tomorrow like it shows on the app is not a good option
@USAirways can i please have someone call me 781 879 4505
@USAirways lol me too
@AmericanAir Thank You! CC: @packermama1
@united ^GJ I do believe that this is hands down the worst service I've EVER experienced. Makes @comcast look amazing. #UnitedAirlines
@VirginAmerica I emailed your customer service team. Let me know if you need the tracking number.
@USAirways HELP! It says "the payment is denied" but my money has been taken out of my bank?  And it says I have no trips coming up??
@AmericanAir Thank you so much.
@united 4840 You knew this flight was delayed! MHT to ALB to EWR to get crew. Your arrival is Late Flightr than the departure! Update your site!

@USAirways your airway is a joke. I have never dealt with worse service
@united Turkish Airlines rebooked us a United flight on our second leg from FRA -&gt; IAD. Is there any way to check if upgrades are available?
@united hi -- @united was. Thank you!
@USAirways no. Other than being on my credit card statement, I have not received anything from you and so I have no way to look it up myself
@AmericanAir just curious. Thanks for the response as always, good or bad. Better than your competition.

@USAirways very embarrassing.
@USAirways @AmericanAir I'm stuck in the airport in fresno trying to beat the storm to pittsburgh, and you guys have offered nothing. HORRID
@united I can tell you. Your airline has lost mine and my families business. This day and age message through Twitter travels fast.
@united we have developers flying down tmrw morn. w/45 min layover, there is an earlier flight to have 1.5hr layover, can move them up?
@JetBlue I shouldn't be made to feel like a criminal because I want to sit near my 5 year old on a flight. #jetblue http://t.co/qgtCao1J2U

@AmericanAir - And @AirSouthwest  had a flight from Chicago to Buffalo about an hour before our flight -- do they not care about safety?
@united Pls Help Baby Hannah get the life saving surgeries she requires.She needs your help.Pls Donate/RT http://t.co/kQnrrP86A5
.@AmericanAir can you connect me to a person without having to wait 2+ hours on hold? I still haven't been able to resolve the problem.
@united JT the issue is with missed connections early gate closings and zero concern from customer service
@united will lose my bag but won't give me free pretzels #frauds

@SouthwestAir hey remember that time you lost my husbands bags? I do. #filmjobnoequipment #nowarmclothes
@USAirways yet again your staff in Philadelphia  failed to send my luggage home with me. #alwayshappensthere #angrytraveler
@SouthwestAir baggage claim has already changed 2x...most recent had 3 bags come out and then stop...claim team has no idea what's going on
@USAirways If you believe in keeping your customers happy, especially after a mistake was made on your part...
@SouthwestAir thanks for the reply, something is off with the phones becuz after 2 dropped calls at 2 hours on hold, I got through on 1 ring
@united We were supposed to board at 605. They just brought the plane from the hanger! WTF did they not know there was a flight?1153 Lax-EWR
@united we had a wonderful flight attendant named Leah that was with us from lga to den, then den to anchorage!
@united love the new 1st class breakfast!
@USAirways seems to be the only airline without a dedicated line for status members
@USAirways suggest you failures make a HUGE donation to @the_USO  Charlotte, NC as THEY provided GREAT customer service today, unlike you.
@USAirways what is policy on changing flight to different dates once your flight has been delayed?
@JetBlue why don't YOU tell them to update the boards?!
@AmericanAir don't see response!
@united that's what I thought! Thanks for the clarification!
@JetBlue Charleston - from your app guys as of a few minutes ago!!! http://t.co/sEUlpvfn95
@USAirways #Wronganswer. Talk is cheap. Customer service is the action of making things right for the customer. #fail again.
@USAirways @AmericanAir won't even refund for a flight they Cancelled Flightled #horriblecustomerservice
@AmericanAir i have been rebooked for the 7am flight. My questions is, why do some people get hotel and the others don't like myself?
@SouthwestAir Flight Cancelled Flightled out of BNA.... Do I have to reschedule now or can travel funds be put back into my account for future use?
@united Thank you. Took care of everything and made it right. That's the experience I'm used to. Opened the app to find flight changed.
@JetBlue we are missing our connecting transportation in Puerto Rico as a result. Need to get to Vieques today.
@JetBlue I have many allergies and want to know if I can bring an 8oz. bottle of Benadryl on the flight along with my 2 epipens?
@united it's 430am and wife still doesn't have her luggage which was promised by 8pm and said to be on its way File number: DCA48810M #Fail
@AmericanAir is there anyone online that can help... the flight leaves in 3 hrs
@USAirways still crickets from customer service.
@VirginAmerica how come ABC is the only one of the network channels you don't have?
@VirginAmerica so loyal that I'm driving to #NYC from #PA, to fly Virgin,  since you cut #Philly flights ;)
@united is pri boarding for "Active Military" or only "In Uniform?" 90% can't travel in uniform for OPSEC reason, even on official travel

@SouthwestAir Oh no worries NL, no disappointments here. Better to have NO lounges than like #Delta who has them but does disappoint!
@USAirways your ticket agents at gate 4 in Providence airport rocked tonight, especially Kristy, sorry if that is not the correct spelling.
@united could really use your help getting our bags at IAD. We're headed to YOW but now going to YXU

@united employees are the angriest, angst-iest group of people anywhere (except for Tasha at check-in at IAH.) @dad_or_alive
@SouthwestAir you know what'd be beyond awesome? A pair of tickets to the @Imaginedragons show in ATL. A girl can dream #DestinationDragons
@SouthwestAir hello I was talking with @SouthwestVerity but it says you moved here, they sent me a voucher but does not work can u help?
@VirginAmerica #thankyou the DAL-AUS route makes my day!!!!
@SouthwestAir frustrating indeed especially when no one knows what the issue is....
@united assistance with what, the attitude of your staff no matter which airport we are at?
@JetBlue @Cinnabon the two of you should team up to serve cinnabons on the flights!!!! #BonsInTheSky
@JetBlue I'm looking every day just watching for a deal. I have specific dates so fare finder doesn't help me
@jetblue when i sign in into TrueBlue, why do I have to do it twice? happens to everyone around me
@JetBlue I don't know- no one would tell me where they were coming from - I would guess so as that's where we had all the changes to flights
@USAirways an already pleasant flight from London to Charlotte (US733) was made fantastic by an amazing attendant. Thank you so much Robert!
@USAirways what's the charge for oversize? Not overweight
@JetBlue well, your new baggage fees, fare structures and reduced legroom has turned you into every other hated carrier in the US. Congrats
@USAirways just Cancelled Flighted my flight and told me to call to rebook. Been on hold for 48 minutes at 4 am and still waiting
@JetBlue your blue helped bring out the color of my eyes. And I promise I didn't eat all the free snacks.
@AmericanAir I'm frustrated by all of the @USAirways attitude toward #ExecPlat members. #thenewamerican
@USAirways I didn't even leave the airport and you sent 2 of my bags to Philadelphia!
@AmericanAir they don't even give an option to hold.. Just say lines are busy Plz try Late Flightr
@USAirways your phone system is not working at all I have been bumped again so now I am at 3 times I need to get out of mco

@USAirways Good news, we got fixed.
@united is trying to strand us in Houston until tomorrow morning. pretty sure overFlight Booking Problems and maintenance aren't our fault.
@jetblue thanks

@united The third wheelchair is broken! http://t.co/tvk0PyxQv5
@SouthwestAir had to be stuck in the middle seat :( http://t.co/dzeGAPfqw1
@united Why tell us flight is delayed, then tell us it's on time again with 20 min to spare? Don't say it's delayed unless you're sure!
@USAirways @AmericanAir  stranded in North Carolina and trying to figure out options but can't get anyone to talk to
@united heard about the voucher/miles credit for Cancelled Flighting my international flight yesterday, but I didn't get an email.
@united The pilot of UA475 just landed this plane like he was gently placing us into a pile of whipped cream. Smoothest landing ever.
@USAirways No speciifc email. 1500 character limit for complaints. Is AA/US customer complaints adopting the twitter model?
@united congratulations united. Fail again. Sky at a gate with a plane full of people waiting on 2. Weather gets worse now we can't leave.
@united 2 employee yelled at her. 3 employee stood with others whispering and pointing at her from behind counter
@united which is why my next flights to Miami will be on another airline.
@USAirways Total BS... I offered to pay for a full First Class airfare ..Told Sold out.. 3 seats and they gave the seats to others... #crap
@JetBlue thanks!! Great service in #T5 already! #lovejetBlue
@AmericanAir AA 2258 why have you Cancelled Flightled our flight without courtesy of notifying us or alternatives?  Very poor.
@SouthwestAir heard you are saving 30k a year on fuel not carrying around those skymall's #ripskymall
@AmericanAir yes and the auto rebook confirmed an outbound that departs after the return flight.  # fire the software programmers
@SouthwestAir can you please DM me? I have a question for you :)
@united flight 4841...3 gate changes on top of this.  Really hoping you can compensate with some points/mileage to my account!
@united been on the phone for over an hour with customer service and they can't figure it out! awesome service... NOT!
@united Okay, thank you both.
@AmericanAir TSA. When I tried to check in the things I've bought your people told me it was Late Flight to do it. So... I want my things back
@AmericanAir thank you we got on a different flight to Chicago.
@USAirways ever think about hiring more agents? Come on now. Don't you think 4 hour holds is a little ridiculous? Get a clue
@AmericanAir what an incredibly arrogant thing to say while I sit here at O'Hare waiting for your incompetent airlines to refuel on a...
@AmericanAir appreciate it!!
@USAirways I just want to find my bag so I won't have to go through the hassle of trying to claim what was in my suitcase #usairwaysfail

@SouthwestAir may I have my Companion pass please.
@USAirways comedy of errors continues..." We can't get into our gate, there is a broken down truck in the way" #fail
@united please arrange someone at the arriving gate of flight 5957 to Chicago for either a refund or first class upgrade
@USAirways @nburnside26 Well if you really didn't like them then she would be on an airplane. #FIOUSAirways üíÅ
@AmericanAir Stuck in Miami, and one of the worst customer experiences I have ever had. Will be sure to let everyone know about my time w/AA
@AmericanAir is that the "record locator"?
@united UA276 sitting at EWR nearly an hour after sked.  Pilot says computers down but no clue when we will leave.  Can you help?
@USAirways took me 4+ hours to book flights yesterday due to system errors between you and @AmericanAir. paid $320 extra due to time lapse
@USAirways  please don't go to the check in process @AmericanAir uses at #MCO. It's an absolute disaster.
.@united in the future when delay causes 15 hour wait (slept night in airport) ensuring seating choice for replacement flight would be good.
@SouthwestAir loses baggage a day ago and still has no idea or interest in finding it? ALL items for new job in that bag! Unacceptable.
@JetBlue @amybruni @DIRECTTV but of course! :-) #bestdressed #bluecarpet
@USAirways just wasted another hour of my life on hold. this is insanity. there has to be another way to use my voucher as payment online
@united it was credit from my last trip that never came in the mail!
@JetBlue's CEO battles to appease passengers and Wall Street - Waterbury Republican American http://t.co/Xf9MPnAaJE
@united be patient while I let this string of tweets go out showing people you are bad at your business
@united I send an email about my bad experience and you send back a generic response.  Yet another reason why I'll never fly with you again.
@united @FAANews unacceptable practice to leave Cancelled Flighted flight passengers to sleep on cement with no pillows #UA1724 http://t.co/nDTLJ15ZpU
@USAirways I lost an ID on your plane and having trouble finding a contact for your lost and found in Cleveland Hopkins Airport. Please Help
@united hey I left my favorite blanket on the plane bring it back home to me:-(
@JetBlue Seriously, what is your solution? Who exactly will help my 5 year old if there's a problem with the plane? http://t.co/vPDRPLXj5a
@USAirways have done that. Sadly no flight from CLT has gotten to IND today and we head back to Tampa tmrw.
@JetBlue Unhappy with 4 hour delayed flight.. Missed dinner
@JetBlue alright.
@AmericanAir speaking 2 languages paid off! as the US line left me over 70 min in hold -without an answer- the latinamerican solved in 20min
@JetBlue I will. Thank you!
@JetBlue when can we start Flight Booking Problems flights for November?
@united I'm glad 1K means something, lol!
@USAirways OFFERING to give up my bag which you usually have to force passengers to do. I am in a state of shock.
@SouthwestAir JH thank you. I finally got through the second time.
@AmericanAir Thanks! He is.
@USAirways new F/As from DFW to CLT this morning did a great job. Well Done!
@JetBlue we are well aware. Insufficient info. No options.
@USAirways that seems unlikely without a crew here to board us
@SouthwestAir Also, will Southwest have any other specials like the one they are running now?
@SouthwestAir when are you starting routes to #Hawaii and #Canada?
@AmericanAir -- This is after you Cancelled Flightled our flight into Buffalo because of "weather" and lied to us and said other airlines Cancelled Flightled
@united the lounge tells us they have no pillows for my grandma as one of the ladies opens the closet and I see 2 right there. #unitedlies
@united chase says no referral bonus. Thanks.
@united why do I have to request refund? Why charge twice in first place?
.@SouthwestAir I appreciate that, and not to be rude, but it doesn't solve much. You should AT LEAST cover the cost of stolen goods.
@AmericanAir ...have you seen Blue? Go look it up :)
@AmericanAir welcome anyone who works in those conditions deserves a thank you even though I am other side of #Atlantic lol xx
@USAirways and apologies are thin when you don't even offer hotel vouchers to your stranded customers.
@USAirways I did &amp; was told I asked to many questions. bag might still be on flight 413. Should be easy to check when it lands in Seattle.
@AmericanAir no no no, YOU DM me, I pay you money and you want to me to reach out to you for help? How about the other way around
@AmericanAir Can I use an SWU on an Finnair codeshare of an American operated flight (JFK-MAN)?  Thanks in advance for the help!
@SouthwestAir no flights to HRL :( is this a limited route?
@united Want to make my day? :) Friend is Premier &amp; I should be soon. Any chance you can upgrade our two 10 hr leg of flights to ecom plus?
@AmericanAir Hi AA friends! My sis's flight AA362 DFW&gt;&gt;MKE was Cancelled Flighted due to weather. Any way you can help here? What are her options?
@VirginAmerica help, left expensive headphones on flight 89 IAD to LAX today. Seat 2A. No one answering L&amp;F number at LAX!
delete your account @JetBlue
@united cannot direct message you you do not follow us. I want my luggage.  Please hep
@SouthwestAir 10 revenue flights since the beginning of 2015?
@united 4 different departure / arrival updates for UA304??? In 1hr. Please!
@united WORST SERVICE EVER. Denied access to our flight and then moved flight 6 times. How hard is it to schedule a gate? @Delta next time.
@AmericanAir 1-the lavatory freezes, 2- problem with a nitrogen line 3-a low tire with the inflating equipment malfunctioning #AA2444 and...
@VirginAmerica I cannot even open my laptop in seat 4C and I paid a premium for this?!!   Let me out of here!
@united - 75% of a plane's passengers boarding in your "Premier" groups might be an indication of a broken process.
@SouthwestAir thank you for your help resolving my problem Shannon ROCKS - even though Rhonda didn't !!
@united Did you find out where it is? Thanks
@united a baby shit its pants half way through my flight and it smelled like shit, what are you going to do about this?
@united Too Late Flight, damage has been done. Easily the worst airline experience of my life. Missed two connecting flights &amp; days of work. #UA49
@united oh, the Wi-Fi router is on top of the fuselage! ;)
@USAirways you are the actual worst.  You have zero respect for your passengers. I'm officially done flying with you.
@JetBlue love you guys. You know that. But I paid for prem. wifi toplay @vainglorygame. No go. Ping terrible / up too http://t.co/CmjRIWOP7O
@USAirways Thank you!!! This whole crew has rocked through bad weather and diversion. Pilot keeping us well informed. #customerservice
@SouthwestAir nbd I was able to figure out a workaround. Just wanted to help. Got my bags less than 24 hours Late Flightr. Muchas grassy ass.
@AmericanAir Thank you for the response. Much appreciated!
@AmericanAir you changed my AAdvantage travel plans &amp; I called 800-433-7300 to get help but it sea ur too busy &amp; hangs up on me. What gives?
@SouthwestAir how come on mobile I can't proceed w/o entering a postcode at purchase. I'm from Ireland and I don't have a postcode just.
@SouthwestAir we're doing our best; sitting at a gate waiting (while not being given information why we're delayed) isn't making this easy
@united lets do that can you email boarding pass?
@SouthwestAir @love_dragonss lol I'm sorry I'm just seeing this now but LAUREN OH MY GOD AHHHH
@SouthwestAir is the best airline hands down. Amazing customer service, bags free and affordable flights. #happycamper
@AmericanAir hi there flight from Dallas just Cancelled Flightled going to LA. Can u pls help rebook me?
@USAirways not happy!! Trying to get home on Cancelled Flighted flight&amp; been on hold for 2 hours. Help!! This is just crazy...
@united you too!
@united Yes I did.  We headed out to de-ice 5 minutes after I sent it to you.  Made it to Austin, but am now waiting for the luggage.
@united I really have a hard time believing that 4 planes in this terminal are all delayed for mechanical issues. #whatgives #dullessucks
@SouthwestAir How do I retroactively add previous flights/miles/points to current rapid rewards balance?
@USAirways 45 minutes on hold no help
@AmericanAir Hey AA - can you help with an itinerary for a plat custy?  Stuck in PVR and phones aren't working
@JetBlue I am But Your customer service is Brutal.
@AmericanAir This is very true. Another reason why we stay South in the Winter months of travel http://t.co/fgJbex480D
@shannonwoodward If you want, we can keep you updated on who's wearing who, &amp; who's with who, &amp; who wins what. We're nice like that. ;)
@United terrible illogical re-route after Cancelled Flightled connection. Then made me pay to check bag. Then lost bag. #ual
@AmericanAir Lets hope it stays that way.Big thanks to your ground/outside crews all across the US the last month. Great FB post yesterday.
@USAirways what happens if the flight takes off before we Cancelled Flight?? That's the issue. We don't want to pay because of your inaccessibility!
@usairways if you could change your name to @southwestair and do what they do...that'd be awesome. Also this plane smells like onion rings.
@USAirways asked her why needed to take yellow tag off. She said, "because I told you to!" Expect a personal apology from her- unacceptable!
@united Thanks! LOL! #UA6259 will wait for us. Per @flightaware, same tail number as #UA5525 :)
@USAirways your customer service is horrible
@AmericanAir Flight 35. I'm on my way.
@AmericanAir awesome. Thanks!
@AmericanAir  hung up on now many times trying to cal 8004337300 crazy
@JetBlue can I change my flight if I already printed my boarding pass?
@USAirways any chance of a travel advisory or DCA this weekend?
@united Ok thank again for your help!
@SouthwestAir still haven't been able to get through, thanks for responding
‚Äú@SouthwestAir: @TinaIsBack I'm so sorry for your frustration. Did you get rebooked? ^SW‚Äù I've been rebooked 4 times!! Still stuck!! #SMH
@AmericanAir the worst first class boarding service I ever had.
@united it seems like no one from United can help me. Lots of fingers pointed, zero people stepping up. At least the gate has Oreos
@united no commitment to a good turnaround, an operations mgr would have counted a dozen small issues with individual performance
@VirginAmerica I'm trying to check into my 10:50AM CT flight tmm on the desktop website and it's not working (some sort of caching bug) SOS
@united basically, I need to leave from Hawaii Late Flight evening (midnight) and get back to Philly Late Flight Monday night. Most trips get me in Tues
@JetBlue the worst flying experience I've ever suffered through. I'd appreciate my money back.
@united that is not in line with your responses here. And now I'm waiting until tomorrow morning because all the flights are overbooked.
@VirginAmerica Flying LAX to SFO and after looking at the awesome movie lineup I actually wish I was on a long haul.
@JetBlue I'm trying to add my 2012 flights to my Badges account but i don't see an option. Help plz?
@united instead of be told when we board, we have to wait for the emails telling us about the delays.
@united CDG-LAS 42 hours. And my luggage is in SFO. I've been wearing the same clothes for 42 hours. Thank you. #flythefriendlyskies
@VirginAmerica Can you give me Silver Status for 12 months?
@AmericanAir after losing my bags for 4 days&amp;charging me $475 to"arrange pick up"in argentina,claiming tollfree: won't reimburse me. Help!
@SouthwestAir I was just sitting here talking at a tech conference about how awesome you guys are and this rolled across. Luv you guys! #LOL
@united once he found out we had a problem he avoided me like the plague. Was told "we can't find a supervisor."
@United - routing a person from Houston to Newark, NJ  and then to SFO is not acceptable.
@SouthwestAir have sent you a DM with the details. Thanks!
@SouthwestAir great news for @PortColumbusCMH today. Finally, Columbus' top unserved market will have flights.
@AmericanAir do you guys have another flight for today that you can book me on from laguardia to louisville ky?
@SouthwestAir flights from sunny SFO delayed for hours and others Cancelled Flightled left and right with little updates. Any help @SouthwestAir?
@USAirways  thanks! Now I just need to locate where my luggage is!
@USAirways Past tense re help. No more. It‚Äôs been even more miserable than usual at CLT.
@USAirways we are on the 2pm flight FLL to PHL and then connection to MAN. However, with the delays we might miss it. Can we go earlier?
@AmericanAir I need a flight out tonight. Isn't there anything else?
@SouthwestAir my wife and 9 month old might miss flight and next direct is 210 pm. Mother in law been on hold with customer support for 30
@united awesome new plane flight 1701
@AmericanAir that 2 hr wait became a 4 hr one. And y'all claimed to have sent an email. Yeah, that never happened. #FlyDelta
@united is the worst airlines sitting on the plane at  Houston-bush airport now for an hour and a half waiting for Late Flight passengers
@JetBlue Thanks. So the delay was the result of scheduling issues more than weather reLate Flightd problems?
@united reservation was made last July. I want to know why I wasn't reseated. This only happens on international itineraries
@united how are you going to rectify this? Please direct me to your complaints department #stickingToDelta
@AmericanAir thanks
@united hey, left my computer bag, w/computer inside, in United, filed online report, no response
@JetBlue thanks for replying-I feel a little better we'll see how it goes ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚úàÔ∏è
@JetBlue I tried a burger which was good but expensive! Were lead to believe that food in the USA is cheap butnot here!
@united yes #LHRT2 lounge is fantastic, if only the US ones could be remotely similar!
@SouthwestAir LOVE your TV ad with the girl dancing. Makes me laugh every time, AND now I want to take a trip! :-)
@united 3pm and my bags still not here. not even a courtesy toiletries kit. not the flight experience I was expecting, very disappointed.
@united thanks for the help. Wish the phone reps could be so accomidating
@USAirways never received such horrible service or treated so poorly as Richard P. today. No excuse for attitude &amp; ripping up our tickets!
@united @annricord $856.81 the cost of one of the round trip tickets.
@SouthwestAir I want to file a formal complaint against a disgruntled employee @ LaGuardia who ruined mltple people's travel plans yesterday
@SouthwestAir I'll stick with flying for free any where that Southwest goes; my son works for this wonderful company and Moms fly free.
@SouthwestAir Buying Early Bird was pointless. You moved me to a diff flight b/c first one was delayed, so I lost my boarding position.
@AmericanAir =UNAmerican Airlines just lies and poor customer services...
@united is probably the least satisfactory airline I've ever been on. Never fails to disappoint.
@united right... Are you guys charging for the air we breathe next?
@AmericanAir is AA951 to S√£o Paulo taking off today? Your colleagues won't tell us any thing
@united now there is no one to operate the ramp to let us out of the plane in IAH...wow..just wow
@SouthwestAir continues to prove to be the best airlines üí™
@united your website is a complete joke when using safari!
@AmericanAir pleaseeee find my suitcase. I want deoderant and a clean shirt for work tomorrow :(
@SouthwestAir I'll have to drop by next time I visit!
@SouthwestAir When are you going to be flying in and out of Nashville? The Deicer is in. Are you short on planes and is it tomorrow morning?
@SouthwestAir is this a joke? My return flight is delayed too! 3 in a row! New record from you guys üíîüò™
@JetBlue flight 1041 to Savannah, GA

@united do you think there Will problems at Newark, NJ on Saturday due to expected snow?
@united happens every time in and out of Newark.
@united Thank you for the new Club at O'Hare. Very comfortable. You made the difficult weather days proficient and enjoyable.
@united @annricord 0162431184663.3 of your agents said we would be refunded. Agents said United should never have sold us the ticket.
@USAirways is there any way that you could hold flight 628 in CLT my husband is stuck in the security check line. flight scheduled for 1PM
@USAirways  thanks I hope I get to my destination
@united i emailed the customer care via the website form. After a long wait Rachelle resolved my issue. But I'm still irritated w/ united.
@SouthwestAir now it's delayed until 3:55. Getting yelled at by attendants not to bother them. Getting worse
@USAirways sadly that didn't help me at my meeting at work today seeing as my presentation was in there! Major strike against me!!!
@VirginAmerica You have any flights flying into Boston tomorrow? I need to be home and you Cancelled Flightled my flight and didn't do anything
@JetBlue #FlyingItForward I'd fly to Port au Prince, Haiti to help with the on-going earthquake relief efforts. Still lots to do there!
@USAirways #stuck in Florida with no flights... Service sucks here. #nofood #nodrinks #nohelp
@united more people would catch their flights if your attendants had more help!
@united why do you hate your passengers?
@SouthwestAir would someone please DM me the customer relations number. The website has only customer service.
@SouthwestAir when is the last chance to get #DestinationDragons tickets? I would die of happiness if I won üò≠üôè
@united &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;-------- do not reply to emails?
@SouthwestAir thank you, will do
@JetBlue @cflanagian she's on to something
@SouthwestAir + @twitter  = outstanding customer service!  Thank you!
@USAirways tough night, two 90 minute calls, on hold, delayed here in Phoenix for two days because of one aircraft not ready? Not acceptable
@AmericanAir I left something on my flight from ORD to SFO earlier today and believe it's on the plane back at ORD now. Please help.
"LOL you guys are so on it" - me, had this been 4 months ago...‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/LYcARlTFHl‚Äù
@united My feedback and concerns via your site aren‚Äôt going to improve my poor airport experiences.
@united please update what is going to happen to passengers now that flt ua14 has been Cancelled Flightled
@AmericanAir  many have missed connections already b/c of delayed flight which will finally board soon
@united a) she's an international. Her phone is on the fritz, I had to get to Chicago from nearly 4 hrs away to figure everything out.
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/3kVkd8yRxa‚Äù + lol wow

@AmericanAir We all did! Skipper's walk-around too :(
@united can you make sure I‚Äôm on the upgrade list for 2/23 EWR-PDX using my GPU priority? Got a weird email about it.
@USAirways will you hold #475 today for connecting passengers coming from delayed flights?
@united -- overFlight Booking Problems planes, Departing delayed, Returning for 'more quick fixes' &amp; breaking out attitudy-customer service? #worstairline
@JetBlue Cancelled Flighted my flight. Went with another airline 2 leave 2day. They Cancelled Flighted also. Called JetBlue &amp; got same flight but now $250 moreüë∫
@SouthwestAir, you're really going to let @delta and @virginamerica get the best of you? http://t.co/vUdWJm1lYB
@AmericanAir It just hangs up and your agents on the ground are useless. How don't I have a seat on a first class ticket booked weeks ago?
@AmericanAir  They said it works 80-90% of the time, DFW security entrance C26. Before/after pre-check, whereas I paid for the service.
@SouthwestAir thank you for the response. How can I got about getting the points onto my rewards account?
@AmericanAir called last night, after 10hrs got call back, can I get a one day pass to admirals club? I'm going to be spending 7hrs in DFW
@united @simonroesner you'll need to upgrade the seats too, even in economy plus it's like sitting on a concrete bench.
@VirginAmerica Lister to my show my on Monday 1230 130
@USAirways the voucher you give us for a hotel is useless you call the number they say no rooms available what do you expect me to do?
@virginamerica What is your phone number. I can't find who to call about a flight reservation.
@USAirways So any ideas when the IT Geeks will plug in the servers so 639 can be on its way to PHX?
@AmericanAir by far the best example of the worst company @Cowboycerrone
@USAirways not likely, flightaware says plane is still in Durango and hasn't departed.
@VirginAmerica @SSal thanks!
@united I looked on the email chain and there is not one
@AmericanAir but the issue is were waiting on rampers to close the door..only to waste more fuel&amp;likely to be told we need more fuel.#cycle
@JetBlue upset with the lack of communication we've received for our "on time" flight 1170 out of MCO
@JetBlue Airways Corporation Insider Trading Update - Rock Hill Daily http://t.co/vvzkSMFKVw

@JetBlue is the trueblue site broken at the moment?
@united I lost a voucher that I was given in Miami aeroport on jan 26. I did not use it.
@USAirways Is there a phone line to call into that isn't being affected by "bad weather"? Trying to book a vacation, here... üëÄ
@southwestair SWEET!!! Glad to hear it. I'll keep you guys in mind next time!

@AmericanAir Any way that we could look at other options for today?
@AmericanAir Haha I had a boarding pass for 12B, was boarding the plane and the gate agent told me to go to 41G. I'm here now. No worries.
@united line full of worried customers and guy at desk says so sorry you will have to take care of your problems Late Flightr I don't have time.
@AmericanAir This is getting out of hand. I called Reservations to reserve the seats that it won't let me select online and there's a fee...
@AmericanAir No snow in St. Louis. Cold but no snow. Hub flights welcome.
@united No wonder the cabin is filthy. #badservice
@USAirways I've been trying to call you for days and every time the system is overloaded and disconnects. Really?  A global company?  Help!
@AmericanAir  upon entering plane to 2 @USAirways stewardesses: "can I have some water?" "no we don't do that. please take your seat"
@USAirways it is just bad practice and I am disappointed that your airline was not prepared...honestly the last time I fly with you guys
http://t.co/EIw2sYb8Fu roberts&amp;s=1 @AmericanAir
@SouthwestAir Great #BlackHistoryMonth commercial! Thx! #ATL #singer #musician #life #BlackLivesMatter

@USAirways Strike Three!!! You guys suck!!!
@USAirways I waited customer service 32 minutes on the phone w/o response. Had to hung up in the end since my battery died due to waiting!
@JetBlue Thanks!  I made it üòÉ
@USAirways 2 bad planes &amp; 3 gate changes= lots of exercise. #travelfail let's hope this plane works. I'm tired.
@USAirways sat on the ramp for 45 min and missed my connection. No one seems to concerned at usairways.
@united I need the phone number to baggage claim in LAX, my mom left her phone and someone called saying they would put it there but on
@united This ALWAYS happens with you guys, and it makes traveling incredibly stressful and uncomfortable. Is that good business to you?
@SouthwestAir That was Chantilly, Paris, France.
@USAirways   US AIRWAYS DON'T CARE FOR CUSTOMERS. Worst experience today with US airways.. Myself, wife and toddler
@SouthwestAir  what is the status on flight#122 STL-AUS?

@AmericanAir Im trying to call and book a reward ticket on one world partners but your automated system wont let me talk to any1.  Great job
@united 15.99 for wireless?  Was 6.99 epic #fail . #greedy #piggy you are the worst!

@USAirways yes, thanks but took forever
@VirginAmerica  I applied over 2 weeks ago. Haven't heard back and I'm flying this week #disappointed
@USAirways @PHLAirport always nice when a customer service manager threatens customers standing in his understaffed lines for the last hour
@AmericanAir I have never seen such incompetency from a gate agent in years of business travel DFW B16 gate agent needs training or new job
@AmericanAir I still am not on a flight. Ive been here allll day and now we're not boarding because we're waiting for catering?
@USAirways i hope i get the opportunity to join the team with this job opening!
@SouthwestAir thanks to Ella-Mae at LAS counter for going above and beyond to help us get back to ABQ after our flight was Cancelled Flightled!
@JetBlue Or.......how about a 1way LAX-NYC(area) under 190?! Is this possible ?
@united sure but the plane is an hour Late Flight! Your ontime departure ship sailed away a long time back!
@SouthwestAir Whats up with flight 4464 Ft myers to milwaukee???
@USAirways we were moved to a delta direct. Thank you for the accommodations!

@SouthwestAir great cabin and flight crew this morning on #578. A great smile and happy staff are signs of a happy company. Thanks.
@AmericanAir doesn't care about customers, break your gear and tell u they can't do anything. @WSJ @latimes @chicagotribune #media #filmcrew
@SouthwestAir will you please work out a contract with @triflight to offer service there..
@AmericanAir there was also not one single person at the counter answering questions for our plane full of confused people. No staff at all.
@AmericanAir after waiting for a delayed plane, we sat on the plane for an hour waiting for a Late Flight passenger. That's BS too..
@VirginAmerica is my new go to airline
@united the wait time for a baggage question is 60 minutes that's crazy is there a limit to the amount of bags I can bring internationally
@JetBlue sorry, should have specified I meant ground traffic trying to get into the terminal
@AmericanAir no gate agent after 30 minutes to let us off the plane???? WTW / grounds crew is here / hope you're ready to cover my delay
@AmericanAir it's flight 5348
@AmericanAir I do not need an apology. I need you to fix it in a competent manner.
@AmericanAir Flight AAL65 declared state of emergency? Squawking 7700...
@USAirways Hi. I'm in LGA but my luggage is in CLT. Have been told to come back tomorrow to collect. Do you guys want to cover my taxi fare?
@AmericanAir trying to change my flight and you just hang up on ppl bc call volume is high. That's a joke, right?
@SouthwestAir MCO-&gt;DCA flight almost full of people screwed by the MSY-DCA Cancelled Flightation. @united and @USAirways didn't Cancelled Flight. SWA=mistake.
@united what I don't understand isn't flight that I paid premium for getting Cancelled Flighted and the best you can do is next available flight...
@united U kept passengers waiting all night 4 a plane that was being put out of service.  Leaving everyone stranded for night. #inexcusable
@united it's a shame the great customer service wasn't continued in SFO. Slightly absurd
@SouthwestAir is there a problem with the website? I tried making changes w/ the app and the site but got "unspecified errors"
@JetBlue thanks for the response. We are hopeful.
@USAirways what's going on in CLT?
@AmericanAir thanks for the info Is there a number I can call to speak to a person? It's going to take an hour to type it out
@JetBlue we are trying to go as far away from King'sCollegeLondon as possible for charity today. Would you help us ? #jailbreak #RAG
@USAirways Thank you
@united still can't dm, it's LH7631 on 21/2/15
@united really 1st flt frm IAD 2 IAH is - Late Flight &amp; -going via Nashville? #inconvenience. Downgraded but not on ticket
@USAirways Sitting at the gate on Flight 719 for an hour due to Sabre being down. What backup plan is in place if Sabre cannot be fixed?
@AmericanAir fl 249 to DFW is leaving Newark on time but is going to Nashville first.  Will I get stuck in Nashville?
@AmericanAir 8:30 departure?  Sure. Is there a catering strike at JFK?  @FoxNews @CNBC @BloombergRadio http://t.co/HPgXYZRW8o
@united Don't know her last name, but Karen at your call center is terrific.  Friendly, helpful.  Terrific representative. Kudos.
@SouthwestAir I made it! Heading to Denver, and your employees really are as pleasant as I just told someone your application asks.  Thanks!
@AmericanAir Call me Chairman, or call me Emerald. After what you did today to me, you can call me a former customer.
@JetBlue Even though this flight #226 didn't have much needed hot beverages 4 us NY-ers, the landing was super smooth üëçüëç üòä #happytweet
@AmericanAir can we get a status update on flight 1457? Are we going to make it home tonight...?
@united uh - I booked it through the UA website. Why the price change?
@AmericanAir how did my prime, ticketed seat get switched on AA 343?! Not sure what's going on here...
@JetBlue Thanks so much for talking to me! The article about #Twitter chats came out great! http://t.co/rKorHvR9z1 #contentmarketing
@AmericanAir your customer service is inferior to that of a nationalized third world nation's airline. Get it together.
@SouthwestAir I have a flight to Vegas coming up soon, but haven‚Äôt received any drink tickets Late Flightly. Can you help me out?
@united Nope. Walked up &amp; down the ORF terminal, &amp; not a United agent to be found. Showed up @ last minute to board us. Many panicked people
@JetBlue I had a SJC to JFK departing 10:55pm tonight. I have to now change my whole schedule. Can we get a sort of refund for this?
@americanair new plane, #gogo, easy power for laptop, iPhone, just missing a good boat-style swivel cup holder for my #dietcoke #happyflier
@united fyi the site/app still shows plenty of the unavailable flights I had errors with. Almost 24 hrs after sellout. Flying @AmericanAir
@united thank you for the quick response but I cannot dm you until you follow me as well
@USAirways Flight 1815 (N747UW) arrives at @FlyTPA following flight from @PHLAirport http://t.co/TtLwZgIyAg
@VirginAmerica has getaway deals through May, from $59 one-way. Lots of cool cities http://t.co/QDlJHslOI5 #CheapFlights #FareCompare
@united I need a breakdown of what the "international surcharge" on my flights cover. Please help
@AmericanAir it would be awfully nice if you could send an alert when my flight is Cancelled Flighted. No text, no email, no love...
@united @upgrd I guess the Kit Kat looks tasty... not going near that "sandwich."
@SouthwestAir Can you help me out with tickets to the Vegas event? I would be so stoked!
Oh wow. #sm ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/l0i8fnz3KU‚Äù
@united Currently on standby to Lax then it is a 2 hour ride to Palm Springs. Long day starting at a snowy 3:30 am in philly.
@JetBlue Amazingly Awesome customer service from your reservation agents tonight. Helping correct a mistake. I so love this airline. :)
@AmericanAir-everyone: its been weeks&amp;those dickheads @ AA hadn't contacted me...they lost my checked bag &amp; carryon and haven't offer to pay
@AmericanAir 1138 got us to LGA safely. Thanks for taking the time to make the plane safe before flying!
@AmericanAir will do. I also passed the website around to other passengers.
@AmericanAir @usairways who is the next stop after customer service.
@JetBlue tells me $130 paid &amp; confirmed flight will now cost me $566.80 CASH ONLY @ airport  22 hours before my flight  #RIPOFF #NoSupport
@SouthwestAir Weather seriously cannot even be the only excuse at this point because it was awful service in the summer too. Over it.
@USAirways delayed in philly since 130, sitting onTarmac since 8pm flight 1881 plz contact donaldaroberts1@gmail.com
@USAirways we did. It added about seven hours to our day... So far... Want to take odds on our bags being on the carousel in KC? #notcool

@AmericanAir Cancelled Flightled two flights from Miami to Nashville yesterday and could not get me on a flight for 3-4 days. #Southwestairwasthere
@JetBlue Thank you for credits. However; I submitted complaints about the property on vacation package. Hope you listen!
@SouthwestAir When is the last chance to win #DestinationDragon ???
@AmericanAir so you fail again flight to rdu sitting waiting on flight attendants. your logistics are not good
@SouthwestAir Thanks for the terrible service! Stranded in MDW for 2 days, &amp; now can't find confirmation for rebooked flight from MKE.
@AmericanAir 953 our  fligth Somthing to talk  about this?
@USAirways Awesome USAir, TYSVM &lt;3
@JetBlue, I've experienced better service making connecting flight from @united and @AmericanAir #badcustomerservice #jfk #pr
@united I filed a delayed bag report on Saturday! my flight was Cancelled Flightled and I never went anywhere!
@JetBlue they absolutely guaranteed us we would sit with our kids. Your "terms" response is insulting.  #jetblue
Yes, and it gets disconnected due to the lack of WIFI strength ‚Äú@AmericanAir: @MauererPower Have you reached out to @Gogo for help, David?‚Äù
@USAirways I'm amazed at the lack of communication with the passengers.
@southwestair yeah, 7am flight tomorrow, going to add 60-90 min extra because of the roads / snow
@AmericanAir that's not what I asked :)) I'm looking to change a Flight Booking Problems for 03.03. Can you help
@SouthwestAir RT @kkwhb: Paid for early bird boarding and got B46.  I said to lady, "well, that system is about dead." She didn't understand
@AmericanAir I already landed! But, if you still care it was 1891. Thanks for the help though!, do you k ow what caused the failure?
@USAirways 3818 delayed. blue skies all over. #whyisusairALWAYSDELAYED???
@AmericanAir face palm!!! Cannot believe the last 24 hrs 1.5 hrs of sleep and No and no and what you can't do......
@JetBlue Noooo!! Why is our previously direct flight from FLL&gt;SFO diverted to LAS? Now arriving almost 2 hrs Late Flightr. üëé
@JetBlue Indeed. I don't know what's going on in Pittsburgh that weekend, but, it's drawing a crowd via JetBlue!
@JetBlue I just booked a flight with you guys. I'm reconsidering that decision now after reading this tweet.
@USAirways Don't tell me that. Tell me what I can actually DO to reach someone. I don't mind being put on hold but it won't even do THAT.
@USAirways Got it, thanks!
@SouthwestAir Flying with you in about 2 weeks, bringing blankets bc it's freezing!üòú
@united Flew ORD to Miami and back and  had great crew, service on both legs. THANKS
@USAirways if you mean by posted, no USAir empl to direct anyone, 800# not accepting calls, no contact from USAir re: rebook #greatjob
@JetBlue just wondering if the website is having issues today. Trying to book a flight with my visa I always use and its rejecting it.
@united will I make it with the delay?
@AmericanAir You're right. Someone is up to something...
@JetBlue #JetBlueBOS What's up with luggage for Flt 790 DCA-BOS?  Pax waiting for 30 min for bags...no show. Carousel 6 signs not updating.
@JetBlue WELL...my paid tickets have NO assigned seats at all. So essentially I won't be on this flight unless I pay more.
@jetblue any idea what caused the delay on flight 1316 FLL &gt; Jax ?
@USAirways Please hold flight US 639 in Phoenix! I'm a weary traveler stuck on another flight because the tarmac is having issues!
@VirginAmerica shares rise on Q4 financial results - USA TODAY http://t.co/lFS4PEFE6y
@united the upgrade to first class was a nice way to fix your earlier mistake. Thank you!
@USAirways I'll sincerely regret Dividend miles! Good things coming to an end :(
@JetBlue I've spent three hours talking to all different people, most of which couldn't help. I probably won't be using JetBlue again.
.@united I think not. I'm not flying you again, if I can help it.
@AmericanAir Right. But more than two hours Late Flight, and it seems due to poor communication, which sounded like it was annoying on-plane staff
BUT @united just re-booked to BOS; UGGH!! now 3 hour bus to WMASS home. Could have flown to BDL &amp; back to DC in same time. #unitedairlines
@united @staralliance was there few weeks ago AWESOME,bright vibrant, and NO habitrails
@SouthwestAir will you ever have a nonstop from #SJC to #BNA?? We'll take #SFO or #OAK too! Pleaseeeeee thank you!
@USAirways thanks for making me check my bag when the space was empty and to the flight attendant for the dirty look http://t.co/9rx5HOmM25
@VirginAmerica are flights leaving Dallas for Seattle on time Feb 24?
@AmericanAir lost my cats, missed their flights, kept them crated 30 hrs for a  would-be 5 hr trip. You'll never touch my pets again.
@JetBlue Woo! Update! Flight 915 is now possibly delayed by more than 2hrs!  Power of positive thinking, people.
No. RT @JetBlue Our fleet's on fleek.
@JetBlue only w/ $70 upgrade. Unsure why she can't just switch someone around. I called 24 hrs in advance for this reason.
@united worst flight experience I've ever had. Will never ever fly your airline again.
@SouthwestAir right? We're delayed so I'm crabby. :) Also why do you allow one family member to purchase EarlyBird check in and hold rows?
@USAirways Thanks, but you can't. My flight was Cancelled Flightled for "maintenance" reasons, and the next available flight was too Late Flight for me.
@united 20 min more delays to flt 2086 at sfo 2 load 2 more pax makes no sense. Will strand many of us overnight at ORD due to missed cnxns
@united Nope - still no one helped me.  Giving up on united. #badservice
@united Airline SUCKS! Customer Service SUCKS! NO courtesy! Incompetent - passengers do NOT matter- Bet the CEO is just doing fine though!
@united flying lax to Sfo and system won't let me check in. Your site tells me to do it through @AirCanada and they tell me through you.

@JetBlue thanks to the gent on the phone who fixed my BOS-MCO flight and the fee waiver! A320 now :) #flyfi ! I forget her name :(
@SouthwestAir just got mine..now where to go??
@united the new seats on the Canadaair regional jets just plain suck.
@united Twitter isn't letting me DM you..
@united I'd say most of the public can't extend their vacation a week, point is why advertise multiple flights you can't honor?
@JetBlue just touched down in #NewOrleans for the annual @HeinekenUSACorp national distributor conference! #livethelegend
@VirginAmerica I've applied more then once to be a member of the #inflight crew team...Im 100% interested. #flightattendant #dreampath -G
@united the flt TO ORD is correct.  Per my DM- it is the flight from ORD to CVG I was charged for incorrectly
@USAirways your service has been awful in Boston and I had to pay 25 extra dollars than I was supposed too I am very dissatisfied #mad
@SouthwestAir I was under the impression when there is an 8 hour delay in your flight because of equipment failure, compensation is offered?
@USAirways shout out to Cathy at the Vegas airport check-in for hooking us up!
@united that's right- with an overnight Miami.
@JetBlue we got our luggage after waiting 40 mins and went home right after. Not very family and ADA friendly waiting that long w no chairs.

@JetBlue I can't say what airline I am on right now, but I sincerely miss you. #bestairline
@AmericanAir even when I did get through, no one knew anything about my bag. This is ridiculous, I still don't have my bag from Saturday.
@AmericanAir I remained on hold for 2 hrs to resolve my flight schedule &amp; your system hung up on me. #unhappycustomer
@USAirways I got an email asking me to checkin TMRW for a flight I meant to book for 3/19 - can someone please help! @WallStSlumLord @PKG49
@AmericanAir 2hr and 20 min delayed...still waiting...you need to do something to improve... http://t.co/1m36NTPTR8
@AmericanAir AA1675 now that the airplane has been sitting here for over 24 hrs,there are mechanical problems.BTW,the AA desk is unorganized
@united still sitting here waiting for a plane....4 hours wasted
@USAirways is it your practice to give 1st class seats to us air employees before giving them to chairmans customers sitting in coach?
@USAirways #not happy, wife 40th Bday trip. would like to be fully compensated for both flights

@united booked flights for 2 for $779. Was charged $389.50 twice. Means I can't redeem CC points properly. Would have gone elsewhere.
@SouthwestAir tweet just popped up on my phone with @amin_aur follows. Missing my favorite Southwest pilot and brother.
@USAirways @rylietolbert15 wow you wouldn't say
@USAirways a $75 change is ok most of the time but if there r open seats on earlier flt and no chkd bag, why not let someone fly standby?
@AmericanAir on hold again....estimated 2 hr hold
@united broken light, 35 mins to get bridge to gate, airplane parked wrong , bathroom not emptied last night....your airline in last 3 hrs
@AmericanAir Flight for tomorrow has already been Cancelled Flightled, what do I do now?
@AmericanAir flight 353
@USAirways No reFlight Booking Problems necessary. I can't afford to deal this kind of unprofessionalism again. I would, however, like some type of credit.
@USAirways and next flight delayed as well. 5238 out of Charlotte, is it just my luck or what?
@united dang... I thought I was in a teleportation device! Ua514
@USAirways delays to the max
@JetBlue the lack of TV made it rough, that's literally why I picked y'all over the competitors.
@united I will. I have to get to Bangkok. I have just 17 days to spend with my husband in his mid deployment leave. Like to get there asap
@AmericanAir I Cancelled Flighted my flight. I really don‚Äôt need this much trouble.
@AmericanAir 719. Looks like we are about to get going, finally!
@USAirways "We can't help you. We don't put people up in hotels when you miss a flight it's against policy."
@SouthwestAir My son's flight was Cancelled Flightled today. I was on hold 2+ hours to no avail. Can you help me rebook?
@united on your website it says 10 days. Its been 16 and counting.
@SouthwestAir when will sw return to customer service?  Business travelers made sw now sw ignores us.
@USAirways truly been the worst experience this weekend. Delayed, rerouted 3x, now not boarding A 715 flight and says flight is "on time"
@SouthwestAir All flights are booked . They are saying I have to wait until tomorrow.
@USAirways passengers sitting on plane for two hours flight #4663 from CMH!!!  All other flights have left #usairwaysfail #worstairlineever
@USAirways i have a question. i need to talk to someone by email. Can you give me your email address? Thanks.
.@USAirways Have you just given up?
@AmericanAir @Expedia are killing me. Over 3 hours to get NO human to help me.
@JetBlue I have more flights that I'd love to redeem for some points but they're a little over a year old. Is there a historical limit?
@AmericanAir rebooked into a different airport. Throwing a wrench into plans üëÄ
@VirginAmerica it was amazing, and arrived an hour early. You're too good to me.
1/2 @united Just be honest with your customers. The new seats are designed to fit more rows on the plane. More rows = more money.
.@united Let us know when you find everyone's luggage. Thanks. #UnitedAirlines
@JetBlue Felt a bit like they were adding insult to injury, since we'll be in terminal 5 for seven hours until the next flight :/
@united it's not getting any better. I'd suggest you get a senior manager to this gate , then retrain these gate people
@SouthwestAir I'm going to need you to answer your phones. Being on hold for an hour isn't okay.
@united still waiting for a response on whether or not you allow use of a rear facing car seat on an ERJ145.
@AmericanAir flight Cancelled Flighted out of LAX for tomorrow due to connection in DFW. Help please? we can go out of orange or burbank
@SouthwestAir Already signed up!  Thanks!  Looking forward to trying the Southwest experience.
@USAirways My flight cost me just under $800 and this is what happens? I fly with @united and have no problems. I come the US 4-5 times...
@SouthwestAir I love you Southwest. I accept all your flight attendants and their many talents always! #flySWA
@USAirways what's the issue with flight 4420 from jax being delayed tonight?
@AmericanAir leave our luggage in the baggage claim without any previous information! That's not the deal!! http://t.co/oTTy5rYMzD
@united I do not see where it talks about military baggage fees. Can you please guide me. Thanks
@united Thank you but the person in Houston could only get me a flight routing through Newark, NJ and I'm going to SFO
@USAirways  is there a better time to call? My flight is on Friday and I need to change it. Worried I may be on hold until then.
@VirginAmerica Funny story, your website is broken, you have missing javascript and stylesheets on the checkin process. I dislike this!
@USAirways can I get a free mimosa to compensate my flight delay (yet again) thx
@USAirways flight 2022 out of Phil, no update and was supposed to leave 15 minutes ago.  Sitting in airport, wondering#irritated

@united thnx!
@united followed and messaged. Thanks so much for the help.
@JetBlue flight 894, first officer not even at the airport wow!!!!!! Unreal, staff waited until we all boarded to announce we are delayed.
@USAirways do families no longer get early boarding with young kids?  American, your new parent, gives it to us...
@USAirways tried twice today on hold for 30 min each time. i have things to do so can't live on hold dealing w/ your customer serv failures
@USAirways had to Cancelled Flight 4 of my flights because my versace biceps wouldn't stow completely under the seat in front of me.

@united Could this email be resent as it doesnt appear to have arrived.
@JetBlue that I missed my flight. I had to book this flight extremely last minute due to a family death, there's no excuse for attitude in
@SouthwestAir For example, can't pay 4 hotel &amp; food? Or transport to alternate city we are flying from? Or give clear record of alt flight?
@AmericanAir Please stop changing my flights for Spring Break. This is the 5th time!
@virginamerica Any way to change from Main Cabin to Main Cabin Select (on same flight) without paying a change fee penalty?
@JetBlue no updates on anything! All we know is there is an issue with the front wheels being locked.
@JetBlue is that supposed to change in the near future?
@AmericanAir if you could let me know where I'm staying tonight (if you've booked anything) that would be great. Do I have to go to the
@united is Late Flight again.  Everyone braved the weather and 40 passengers are waiting for a flight crew.  Really!
@SouthwestAir I think I get a faster response on Twitter than I do when I call...what's up with that?
@united I have a question
@USAirways i ve been told that you get a percentage on every plastic bottle that is sold around yout departure section...turn up the heat
@united doesn't help the 100 or more passengers that just arrived an hour Late Flight.
@united no HUMAN contact for 2 mths from @AmericanAir cust relations or refund dept. If ever a problem do u have humans I can talk to?
@USAirways .... I've been trying to get through to book a reservation and the system will not let me through. Day 3 #ridiculous
@AmericanAir has been almost a month and still no response to my online complaint/questions. Out $300 because of it.
@AmericanAir These are some awesome photos. Thanks for sharing! üòÅ
@SouthwestAir thank you!!!
@SouthwestAir staff was overall awful through multiple airports would have switched airlines if another flight was available
@AmericanAir @united contact me, or do something to alleviate this terrible, terrible service. But no, your 22 year old social media guru

@JetBlue this is lovely!
@united nice and early back home! http://t.co/geG4nghmIE
@SouthwestAir Guys for real. I've been on hold for 4+ hours including one hangup. Please have someone reach out so I can get my $ back.
@united this is not what captain said! Your 820pm flight to San Francisco is delayed due to weather. UA1416 now departs ....#failagain
@united I am a comedian and I promise I will make fun of you on stage tonight.
@SouthwestAir I love you guys, but even Comcast has a better phone help system. A simple callback system would fix most of the problem...
@united well, thanks for not charging me for switching my two Cancelled Flightled flights anyway. That was pretty nice. #stillmakingmepoorthough

@SouthwestAir you call this customer service?? Sitting in the tarmack for 1hr, lost bag, and you give me a $100. voucher???

@AmericanAir Thanks for the quick response - it's appreciated!
@united You need to change the way customer service is handled! I have been waiting for a supervisor to contact me for 17 days, what gives?
@united I know where to check. My complaint is my ticket said dinner when I booked now it's changed to refreshments. Where's my refund?
@USAirways My flight finally arrived in Charlotte.  They booked my luggage thru to lga but no room on flight for me.  What a mess
@SouthwestAir Thanks! Confirmation number just DMed. Appreciate any help!
@JetBlue flight was two days ago. Flight 1918 from POS.
@SouthwestAir hey I'm flying from Tampa to Denver today and I want to know if there will be tv's in the seats like @JetBlue
@VirginAmerica missed my flight. How does standby work?
@AmericanAir Trying  to Cancelled Flight fligt 2321 O'Hare to Dallas 12:17pm. High call volume no one answer. Online no confirmation. #thankU
@USAirways I don't want a reservation change, just adding a service. Am going public with this to get help.
@united mechanical issue. Looks like they got it fixed! Thanks for your concern.
@SouthwestAir An Oscar-worthy entrance into LA. http://t.co/10tmtHVFDC
@united ‚Ç¨202.88 is the difference between the booked flights, do you want screen shots?
@SouthwestAir yes we did file a report and were treated rather rudely at midway baggage claim. Now we wait 2 days to get our luggage.
@USAirways 4469, thank you for asking.
@SouthwestAir Report was filed but would like to support some active searching.  Feels pretty passive now.  Info on computer is precious.
@united @suntoshi I still like you united airlines
@USAirways if you are going to make me wait in the phone for a long time can you at least turn off the ads they are eating away at my soul
@USAirways seriously???  did you not see that I've spent 2 days - for multiple hours on hold just to have to hang up after the hours?
@united annnnddddd I'm going to lose my first class seat on the flight they shuffle me to
@united you might be the only airline not offering waivers...keep up the good fight
@AmericanAir @CineDrones I just wish that a team member would pick up the phone at this point, let alone be courteous or helpful üò≥
@JetBlue Airways Corporation (JBLU) loses -0.06% on news that @JetBlue Airways ... - WallStreet Scope http://t.co/oFW4A8b5WS
@SouthwestAir It was never really "lost" it was put on another flight WITH my knowledge we just weren't sure what flight but I have it - TY!
@AmericanAir 11 out of 11 delayed flights, you suck and getting worse
@USAirways my brother @BRizzyberg27 missed his flight traveling home for a funeral and can't get through to the call center, can you help?
@united Ill check it out, appreciate the response, regardless.
@JetBlue I called jet blue to get an explanation, and make sure it would not happen in the future. I was told to write the fraud dept.
@USAirways the disappointment was not the bag but that it arrived before me and I was kept 12 hrs without options in IAH
@SouthwestAir On hold with airline 45 min and counting. Service is terrible!
@SouthwestAir 25 year customer but I am 6 3 and those lost 2 or 3 inches really hurt  every time the person in front shifts he raps my knees
@JetBlue Thank you for the reply. Would've appreciated communication before checking in about the delay. JetBlue used to be my go-to
üò©üò©üò©‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/BBHTlZgH2C‚Äù
@SouthwestAir #tfw1 @JimCramer @AARP TY-Spent total of 3 hrs and 20 mins holding. Cell battery died. Finally made arrangements w kind Rep
@JetBlue Been dealing with a Cancelled Flightled flight since last night &amp; was booked to a 6:15 flight,wouldve at least liked to see Ella perform lol
@united Yes, they did. Must have fixed the broken ramp. Thanks!
@SouthwestAir can't fly in precipitation and @Delta has planes that don't work after 5. 3rd airline had better be a charm tomorrow.
@SouthwestAir yep. 99.99999999% certain it was on that flight.
@AmericanAir yes and I would like a refund.
@AmericanAir Also do you have any way to speak to someone on the phone? Your 1-800 # has been hanging up on me all day.
@USAirways Ten hrs Late Flightr and still here on Army cots @ airport waiting for 11am flight. #poorlyhandled #usairheads http://t.co/18fMr06mn6
@AmericanAir @Cowboycerrone You apologise for HIS frustrations &amp; HIS disappointment but NOT your terrible service? #BlameShiftOverload
@USAirways AND my rebooked flt isn't until Monday??  AND I don't get a voucher for a hotel?!  Never again, US airways.
@USAirways Have you issued a Memphis travel advisory for tomorrow? Winter weather coming through now.
@JetBlue the gate agent said our original plane got de-icing fluid in the engine that created a short so they took the plane out of service
@JetBlue I did...#FlyFi worked well and was free aboard this flight
@USAirways  redeemed themselves!  Flight out at 7:44!!! Had to call and negotiate,  but thank the Lord I'm heading home!!!!!
@united 618 was flight out of Houston
@united of course I need help.  I've been DMing you ladies and gents all day. Your only solution is hope for the best and LAX.
I will, if you can show me where this new program is beneficial to your longstanding loyal consumers... @united
@united @paigeworthy : page United values your tweet b/c it's so rare that they receive tweets complimenting their service...most are fake.
@JetBlue @drwinston001 I think we'll need a selfie as proof...
@AmericanAir confused at the definition of a "preferred seat." I paid extra for one and got a regular seat with no legroom. Unimpressed.
@united as a million mile flier I'm embarrassed to ask how long ago his launched?
@united I'm on one of your 757-300 between JFK and LAX.When r u upgrading planes?Plane has no Screens,lousy seats And that's in UnitedFirst.
@SouthwestAir been with my GF for 2.5yrs, she's from SF &amp; I live in Tulsa. SWA always takes me there to see my love! #SouthwestLuvSweeps
@united why the hell do my miles expire? Was really looking forward to accruing enough for a free flight in 10 years.
@USAirways you airline is doing rather poor right now. In SLC waiting to take off. Was suppose to take off now 2 hours and 3 minutes ago!
@AmericanAir I don't believe it's acceptable to have a ticket # changed after check in time &amp; not be notified. Apparently that's standard.
@USAirways honest question - how is a 1-way ticket from Charlotte (your hub) to LAX (2nd biggest city in USA) almost $600?????
I ‚ù§Ô∏è flying @VirginAmerica. ‚ò∫Ô∏èüëç
@AmericanAir - Reference number to this request: 1-3001408092
@united Okay, thank you for your help :)
@USAirways I needed to be at my destination by lunchtime today. No one could get us on a flight, but I've since learned @Delta had one!
@united completely unacceptable to seat 1st class passenger into middle seat in 38 (not even premium economy)
@united Can you help me get a flight out tonight to Houston?Just don't want to be stuck here till Monday with all this bad weather moving in
@SouthwestAir we're pulling off the runway now! Making new friends with seat mates. Thanks for the response CB.
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/mpi4yuo9jR‚Äù Oh word!!!!??????
@united Flight UA1665 got delayed 2 hours due to a mechanical issue...could use a free drink or 3 to make up for this inconvenience
@AmericanAir @CAexhibitions Sorry in, like, a general way? Or sorry that incompetence/understaffing is compounding weather issues?
@AmericanAir I have no transportation to and going to some other city and getting to NY sometime on Wed?! I'm sorry that's not gonna cut
@SouthwestAir Can you link the article where it says the routes and what times the routes are likely to be? Like TUL-DAL 1:00PM - 7 None
@USAirways thanks for your help! I left a message for DCA lost and found. Fingers crossed we find it!
@AmericanAir seriously, there aren't any reps available to take phone calls? Even for platinum?
@united good try but @SouthwestAir got her here safer and sooner
@JetBlue do you have mint service from NYC to San Diego?
@jetblue I hate you for this üòí https://t.co/g4WwR6VBRQ
@AmericanAir I had a 6am flight I can get no rest because I have to wait another 2 hours to receive an automated phone call. #neveragain

@united sitting in the middle for the first time .. Hope it works out well
@VirginAmerica you know I'm flying virgin for the fight #MayweatherPacquiao
@AmericanAir im tryin to book a flight but cant get ahold of anyone!
@united #customerservice at @Dulles_Airport could not be worse. I get the bad weather, but this is awful.
@united @el_ingeniero don't check your baggage if you don't have to.  They will lose it!
@SouthwestAir but if my bag makes it with me to Greenville tonight then all is forgiven. #HighHopes
@AmericanAir my bags were checked through to Cancelled Flightled flight 362. When will they arrive in MKE? Not much help from grnd staff. Havoc in DFW
@AmericanAir..still here. feet are freezing b/c doors have been open. Flt time was 8:30.  We have fuel but now waiting for "rampers" #AA4285
@AmericanAir no standby line update online or on app either is troubling
@united have you read your own same day travel change policy?
@AmericanAir Pay for my accommodations when you are the ones Cancelled Flightling it for no reason and I know your saying (lying) it cause of weather
@USAirways I tried to call your customer service line only to be kept in a que for over 45 mins...... please hold =we don't care
@united what about the poor customer service at checkin at Kansas KCI?!? That's it???
@SouthwestAir I miss mine terribly. A +1 for my 30th anniversary would be amazing. It would mean LUV is in the air. #dontmakemebeg
@USAirways Cancelled Flightled our original flight to aruba. Now on the way home we were told we don't have seats. Never flying @usairways again
@JetBlue  no ... I am guessing I have to call someone
@united what time does check in open for flight no UA80 from Manchester to Newark today ?
@JetBlue Are there airport-wide delays at BOS or did we just get unlucky with 152?

@united thank you for getting our daughter home when @americanair Cancelled Flightled all their flights to Nashville

@USAirways Today USAir Cancelled Flightled our rescheduled flight &amp; did not notify us except possibly to our home phone-not helpful since we are in CO
@USAirways thank you, but it says the website is down
@JetBlue woof I'm on the red cArpet http://t.co/iIdrbLNOoX
@JetBlue I hope so. The plane does appear to be leaving a nearby terminal for our gate.
@united thx for checking in. Never got through via phone. On hold over hour. How long is too long to wait on hold? Ugh. #csfail
@USAirways Need help with a flight. Weather + funeral = tough combination. On hold for over an hour. Please?
@SouthwestAir 2/22-MDW 2 SAN flt 1687 attendant Melissa was awesome! Fast, smiling, great. After weather Cancelled Flight day b4, it was welcome
@USAirways seriously!!!  Flight Cancelled Flighted. Auto rebooked to Tuesday??? Then 3hr 26min on hold for nothing. Renting car. Want refund!!!!
@USAirways why now just announce delay of 4478 from PVD when you knew captain was already on delayed flight coming in? Frustrating
@USAirways honestly - how is it quickly as possible I've been on hold sine 9:50pm? Everyone that answers has to send me to someone else.
@southwestair TWO hours on the plane at the gate?!? This is undignified behavior for you. And the apology isn‚Äôt enough. #freedrinkcoupons
@USAirways my bag landed 1 day Late Flight at sfo at 11:40am. How can it be 10:01pm and I still don't have it? Flight 719 2/22/14
@USAirways 4097 DCA to BNA. Just told they need to do 1.5 hrs worth of maintenance. Was supposed to leave at 8:50 am. [sigh]
@united flight 4567 have already been Cancelled Flightled once, been trying to get home two days. Staff being very unhelpful.
@AmericanAir yes. He's in the next flight
@SouthwestAir You officially have the worst customer service of any airline I've ever dealt with. #southwestairlines #poor
@JetBlue not one of my four flights this trip has been on time. What the he'll is your companies problem?
@united so this did not work out at all!! Incredibly unfriendly ground staff and false promises over Twitter @theairhelper
@AmericanAir well done, you have taken the fun out of air travel @PHLAirport
@AmericanAir Thank you.
@united this airline is a joke my friends been trapped in houston since 7am sat and have no flight in sight #unitedworstever #trappedhouston

@united I submitted a status match last week and have not heard back. Im a delta customer looking to switch to United. Please assist.

Thank you United! ‚Äú@united: @dan_roam That's a beautiful place to stay a day longer. Have you been re-booked? If not, let me know. ^MN‚Äù

@SouthwestAir IND website says contact airline for flight 899 tomorrow to ATL. On hold for over an hour. Can you give me any more info?
@AmericanAir not yet. I'm next in the terminal a customer service area.
@united still waiting 4 our bags. Web STILL can't tell me its location . How come @UPS @FedEx can tell u at any given minute where it is?
@united seriously?   UA 806.  Delayed because of the copilot isn't here?  For 1.5 hours and he is only flying from Raleigh? Disappointing
@AmericanAir Just followed you.
@USAirways what an amazing day. Delayed 4 hrs bc frozen h2o on plane Now sitting @ gate on same plane 4 30 mins still waiting! #flight1797
@AmericanAir You are jumping the gun and Cancelled Flighting flights that could've made it before the snow. Now, more Cancelled Flightlations. It's ridiculous.
@JetBlue That's not weather reLate Flightd.  You are just being nice and blaming the weather.  Airport just wasn't prepared. Investigation time.

@AmericanAir why would I bother wasting my time calling them when they are gunna do nothing
@AmericanAir but really, can you DM me on here to verify if you've booked a hotel for our extra night here? Kinda unsettling to get a call
@SouthwestAir may want to direct that to the people at @FurryFiesta tok
@united add wifi, entertainment and the old seats and i‚Äôll come back.
@USAirways refuses to compensate passengers when inconvenienced and wouldn't even rebook me on another airline. #disappointed
@AmericanAir thanks for responding ... will do!
@united to top it all off, your flight attendants talked loudly throug the flight, even when the lights were dimmed. Resulting in no sleep
@AmericanAir now 2 hrs! Guess I should just hang up &amp; give up on using my award miles before prices jump? Hm thanks http://t.co/LE4H2gTzXZ
@SouthwestAir AH - did DM, no reply. On hold now over 2hrs. Just spent over $1k to get a United flight tmrw to get home. #lame

@AmericanAir 's computer systems are down, can't leave without a flight plan! Any ETA, American air?
@united Not appropriate to ask in public (hence the dm). each united employee, each a new answer. your process was such a hassle i Cancelled Flighted.

@SouthwestAir still planing on flights into Dal? We are trying to fly in tomorrow from lax

@united 30 of us on flight 1750 trying to get to tel aviv that is trying to take off right now with out us so cruel. Next flight is 350pm
@united Confirmation number: NJV4BP - All I need is email confirmation of flight from NYC - SFO Feb 4

@united thanks for the offer, but I finally made it to my destination, albeit hours Late Flight.
@JetBlue thank you üòä standing in line now!
@USAirways is holding my luggage hostage from flight 5182
@JetBlue Two delays.  A little proactive communication goes a long way. #howhardcanthatreallybe?

@SouthwestAir can someone help me set up a callback today?
@SouthwestAir Thanks for not telling us our flight was Cancelled Flightled, not helping us in anyway and ruining my birthday. #worstcustomerservice
@AmericanAir We don't mind the fee! We were told we can't change name on ticket at all.

@USAirways making folks run from gate C29 to A18 to B11 with NO EXPLANATION and zero carts to transfer elderly and handicap. #PHL
@united trying to reach him for the number. At last they have him on standbye and gave him 1 meal voucher for a potential 2 day standbye!
@JetBlue rocking the Tim McGraw hold music

@united thanks for not letting me switch flights Bc I had a checked bag then Cancelled Flighting my flight forcing me to take another 3 hrs Late Flightr!
@AmericanAir you said this last time. It doesn't take 6 weeks to reply to an email.
@united as for volunteers to give up seats, people did! Now we sit for 25 minutes on plane waiting 4 them to add more people!  #letsgo
@SouthwestAir in my 30 years of flying I have never been so pissed off.  To many incidents for just one flight.
@USAirways i have never been treated so poorly by an airline in my life, as a military family we do alot of flying..
@AmericanAir any ways to get through the 50 minute wait to book a flight?
@AmericanAir 740pm wheels up to be exact.  I'm sending a DM.
@AmericanAir so how do we get me a person?
@VirginAmerica do you miss me? Don't worry we'll be together very soon.
@USAirways not happening #worstairlineever also Marie Burroughs is the worst customer service rep ever #yourairlinesucks
@united How is this considered "on time" if it's arriving at destination half hour Late Flightr than scheduled? http://t.co/YMFTw1uyHr
@united I sent a DM re an existing reservation but no one has responded
@JetBlue - I will for sure. But my TSA-Pre works with other airlines. Why is Jetblue different?
@JetBlue she helped me with my problem so easily and was so nice, you guys rock!
@AmericanAir Your customer relations dept has one-way e-mail. How is not allowing responses helpful?
@VirginAmerica you got cheese pLate Flights too.
@united When will that happen? It really confuses when the 1st content to come on the 6in screens is about how technology forward United is.
@united Okay, just requested to follow.
@SouthwestAir So I am flying Chicago-LAX-PHX just to go spotting at LAX and PHX airports, then I am flying back to Chicago :)
@USAirways now on hold for 75 minutes.
@united take a lesson from @VirginAmerica , they know how to treat customers!
@united we are never going to get to out gate at this rate.
@USAirways thank you very much.
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/M2wSg2olgo‚Äù -_-
@SouthwestAir there really should not be guidance to call via phone if you are that back logged. I could have done it online in 3 minutes.
@united you can read the full story when I submit a case to your team about the pilot of flight 6232 and why we are sleeping in DIA
@united checking to see why flight 3466 (atl-ord) got Cancelled Flighted?
@AmericanAir I'm still on hold if you're wondering...  4 hours 37 minutes and counting.  #ServiceFail #OnHoldForever #Suboptimal
@SouthwestAir Very frustrated for the loooooong wait time to speak to a live person!!! Cannot get boarding pass for flight tomorrow!!
@united Either is fine. However, plundering my hard-earned dollars is not fine.
@USAirways @AuroraBIZ check your bag, @PHLAirport bag handlers broke into my suitcase and stole my camera, bag was returned in a trash bag
@USAirways Unfortunately I doubt that the consistently subpar service will improve with the @AmericanAir merger. #USAirways
@VirginAmerica you should have 39 dollar LAX-Las fares!!!
@USAirways please secure the 'footrest' shelf' in business class on A330 airplanes!!! http://t.co/ZL4bVEXmcJ
@SouthwestAir injured at check in yesterday. U told me to go to dr. on hold with SWA for over hour trying to talk with someone. suggestions?
@united problem is on laptop not phone
@AmericanAir I let a crew member know every time this happens.  Which is most of the time.
@united flight 1491...plane from SFO to DEN is basically on time.
@SouthwestAir no. Told to call cust service on monday
@united I just need to get to RIC tonight. I've been in EWR for 24hrs now.
@SouthwestAir another great trip! LAX 823 - LAS 3075-  BNA. Thanks so much!!!
@united this is me and my partners first trip to #NYC I bought the tickets at the same time Please seat us next to each other ConF# ILC0HP
@SouthwestAir awesome. thank you!
@united The guidelines say 10x9x17, my bag is 20x15.7x8.7, so it's a bit taller than the guidelines. Is that gonna be a problem?
@JetBlue I have to say that JetBlue has officially lost a customer. What a waste of all the points I have too! I am yet to be in a flight..
@SouthwestAir My luggage has still not been found. Luggage is not scanned until final destination. So no way of knowing where it is!
@AmericanAir i appreciate your apology. Sincerely. Thank you. That's really all I ever wanted to begin with.
@JetBlue don't think any1 rly knows what's goin on. supposed 2 leave at 8:30a then 9a then 9:30a then 10a then 11a then 11:30a. Now 12
@AmericanAir but they refused to unload our luggage so we're stuck in below freezing weather w/o our cold weather clothes.
@JetBlue My mother had overheard a personnel ask the attendant if "the passengers really knew what was going on" and the attendant said no.
@united your first class is a joke, compared to all the others I have flown, don't ask for extra peanuts... That's NOT allowed! @AirCanada
@VirginAmerica  how are you gonna have a deal from Dallas to DC but no deal from DC to Dallas? #sad
@united need help. Never got tickets. Conf #ggqzqd
@USAirways hi guys, do you have a general enquires email address please? Thanks David.
@united cabin crew were huge offenders, stood as a conversational cluster blocking exiting passengers

@USAirways #686 is delayed due to tail winds and need to jump on #521 to SEA, leaving the same time this arrives. Is there a chance to hold?
@united our flight attendant @superben was super helpful in finding a bag we left on a flight today. Excellent customer service. Name fits.
@united ours in July. You have ZERO excuses for this. You have an out-of-date system that causes problems like this.
@SouthwestAir Salted or honey roasted? I vote to bring back the salted peanuts. I dread a year of the honey roasted!üòñ http://t.co/RHw78ktQFO
@SouthwestAir can you follow for quick DM?

@United @UnitedAirlines and the hits keep on coming. http://t.co/44ZHmfDIW6 #unitedfail #unitedwithivy
@USAirways @AmericanAir you should partner w/ a different hotel in PHL, the clarion is proving to be very difficult &amp; not customer friendly
@JetBlue awe you guys are great can't wait to travel with you again soon!!!
@united, this is the line in Denver to rebook due to weather issues. DO BETTER. http://t.co/tmccExYaaQ
@SouthwestAir is having a sale! I'm delighted!
@united Thanks for the update.
@JetBlue I bein calling JetBlue no respond I leave my number no call back I think JetBlue is loosing a customer
@SouthwestAir very disappointed in your handling of tonight's Cancelled Flighted Dallas flight.  Not that it was Cancelled Flighted but no contingencies.
@USAirways Mellani B. and whole team in Columbia SC are absolute superstars. Incredibly helpful.
@USAirways we've been waiting at the gate for 2 hrs, why are we now waiting to stow the luggage?
@united I'm not this person, but I've been sitting in Denver for three hours and all I want to do is get on a plane. Please let me go home.
@USAirways @FAANews how can I be stuck on a plane due to snow in Boston when it's not actually snowing in Boston?  Usair flight 2218 #US2218
@AmericanAir The flight was delayed 5 times. Spent almost 40min on the tarmac. I'll reconsider my future flight options.
@JetBlue I like " Follow @JetBlue "
@JetBlue with 3 kids and 11 days 340 + doesn't work and it's months in advance
@AmericanAir I've just received the ticket. Thank you for your help
@USAirways Thanks means a lot after I was verbally cussed out, charged extra for a bag, &amp; then told " I don't feel like dealing with it" üòí
@SouthwestAir been on hold for over an hour.....not cool, you guys.
@AmericanAir, that's not the point. Say its $1300 at the counter when I clearly see $500 on your site? AA agent was @ a loss 4 words, too
@united just filled it out. Hope someone responds before we book our next trip.
@SouthwestAir lemme come to #DestinationDragons üò≠üò≠üò≠ this university student could use a break from all these books.
@AmericanAir @cheerUPDATES So you're saying the call center is understaffed?
@united the aircraft closest to gate was for the other flight and the one closest to our gate was going to Chicago.
@united was told by Supervisor that United disconnected their customer support # so there was nobody to address it now. #igiveup
@united searched for mileage tickets to BOM couldn't find a single one is saver awards - I see how you play.  Earn miles but can't use them.
@united Worst customer non-service for sure!
@AmericanAir from a service rep but that hasn't happened yet. I'm honestly fed up and sick of this. No notice when my flight got Cancelled Flighted
@united Now arriving a day and a half Late Flightr than supposed to. Lesson of the day, don't believe verbal or written confirmations from United
@USAirways @AmericanAir I need to move a reservation due to weather in the middle part of the U.S.  I would like to change departing airport
@AmericanAir YOU FUCKING SUCK
@AmericanAir no worries, loved flying with you guys. Thanks!
@united bagage which i take to in the cabin i dont need to check-in,correct?
@USAirways @AmericanAir now this is beyond ridiculous. Some steering problem delays us again. #neveragain  it's no wonder you had to sell
@united it was UA flight 1001! Now I'm currently stuck in Portland because I missed my ride because of the 3 hour delay. #GetMartyHome

@united - so they changed depart from 1:45 to 2:00pm &amp; it is now 1:40pm &amp; the Capt. just got off the plane to find a smoothie, 2pm my ass!!!
@SouthwestAir ok, gotcha! ‚úàÔ∏èüòÉüëç
@united Your website Flight Booking Problems experience is an obnoxious upsell-laden disaster for anyone with half a brain.
@AmericanAir has no customer service via phone or in person. Just a stone wall with a giant middle finger painted on it.
@united I usually like flying with you guys but $200 fee to use my credit seems ridiculous #notcool #exhorbitantfees
@united I have and been denied! I called and got hung up on. Did speaks with manager on second call
@usairways If I could/wanted to call I wouldn't use the internet to make a reservation.Site won't work on Chrome, on several computers.
@USAirways you run a piece of shit airline!!  Thanks for ruining AA
@AmericanAir you're not finding it bc @united  rebooked us on your airline when they realized they couldn't get us home - and we're at ORD
@united I have sent a message with a bag tag. Have you looked?
.@SouthwestAir Thx for the follow up. Just sent DM
@AmericanAir @superyan I did hear a last call for boarding of this flight when I was at JFK a few hours ago. good luck w/flights!
@JetBlue You just don't get it.  It's not about the money, It's about PEOPLE!!!! How about a public apology from the president of Jet Blue.
üíØüíØüíØ RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/SrM13qbRZD
@JetBlue thanks to you customers like me stay loyal. From check in to landing.
@USAirways You need to contact me ASAP. #Furious

@JetBlue Thx for the quick response .... yep I tried- but it can't find the flight when I Input the Confirmation #
@AmericanAir flights been Cancelled Flightled, can't get through to the desk and nothing showing online under my reservation - what do I do?
@AmericanAir I'd like to apologize to the gate agent for flight AA76, I was not aware that zone 1 was after the nine other precious gems.
@usairways would it kill you to let me put my tsaprecheck number on my reservation?
@JetBlue now we are delayed until 1:02! This is ridiculous
@JetBlue insensitive? #FoodAllergies are life-threatening. Unsolicited UNEDUCATED opinions are inappropriate, reckless &amp; dangerous to (1/3)
@united if I have credit from a flight I Cancelled Flightled does the new flt have to be booked by 1 yr from orig purchase date or flown by that date?

@JetBlue okay. Names of SJ crew are Alamo, Tatiana. Keep telling me to hold, then leave desk. Ali told me he couldn't help bc going on break
@USAirways They charged me for a flight they Cancelled Flightled, unbelievable and unheard of
@USAirways do you operate ANY flights without maintenance issues? Flights in/out of DCA Cancelled Flighted, this is getting old. Update fleet pls!
@SouthwestAir you just Cancelled Flightled my flight home so you better get me a private jet or something. I need to get home now
@SouthwestAir boarding passes now compatible with #iPhone #Passbook http://t.co/1ESmMnIZEk
@USAirways I have a receipt but no conf # for a Thur flight. When I call for help I was literally hung up on b/c of wait times. Help!
@united awesome I'll book my next Christmas vacatinn this December any other ways you want to devalue mileage plus.
@SouthwestAir no I wasn't. After over an hour was too frustrated and had to hang up.
@united I would like your baggage damage number as well! Another great thing from your 'trained' staff! Whats the number please.. Claim time
@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: plane not moving as cargo door open on plane. Umm, ok. A little strange.
@JetBlue I'll pass along the advice. You guys rock!!
@JetBlue I want you to pay for my parking fee at Orlando airport because your app told me my moms flight landed at 9:19 and it lied
@united Tks for reply. PSP employees blamed Late Flight departure on POTUS when main reasons were DVR flt Late Flight &amp; insufficient ground crew to handle
@JetBlue if you want to be helpful, find us a seat. Don't quote terms and conditions. #jetbluefail
@united Do miles earned with Explorer card count toward lifetime miles?
@united nope not here. You need a little red stamp from the counter. Check yourself, before you wreck yourself son http://t.co/0pRGySvuRm
@united Fair enough. I don't usually rant, but it's good to know someone's listening. :)
@AmericanAir just hoping/praying for a safe flight. They've had to stop and de-ice our plane yet againüòû
@USAirways your service at PHL is abysmal. An hour on the runway waiting for a gate, no information anywhere, missed my connection abysmal!
@AmericanAir @USAirways "ma'am if you have a complaint you should visit our customer service desk" {sees line ~45 people deep}
@united averaging 200 minute wait times tonight or what? I've gotten no help from you tonight.
@USAirways what's going on with your website &amp; mobile app??? Help!!!
@SouthwestAir Yes I can. But you guys should get your act together.
@USAirways on hold for 30 minutes &amp; counting to Cancelled Flight reservation booked within 24 hours - can I do it here? conf code: F6DK04 / XZMSCW
@JetBlue Yes That's true but they are a bit pricey I will look into it further. Love you guys.
@united Flight 280
@USAirways delays due to refueling are out of your control? If that's true I never want to fly US Airways again
@JetBlue yeah I'm aware of that. Hence my original msg to you.
@united How can I file a claim when your agents won't let me speak to a supervisor? My claim number is expired because you WON'T find my bag
@united Honestly, I stopped trying to report things via website. Now I just laugh. Flights work. Miles accrue. I'm sure it's just cosmetic.
@USAirways nice touch with using my first name.  Very intimate.  I'll be filing a claim soon to be reimbursed. Have a us airways day!
@SouthwestAir step 1: be less shot. Step 2: acknowledge customers other places than Twitter. Step 3: don't suck so much
See what you started now @nytimes RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/atd2Sm8HF4
@americanair Yes to the iOS. I'm running iOS 8.1.3
@JetBlue anything serious I should worry about?
.@AmericanAir Also, not the reservations team's fault. Bad top-down decision. I feel bad for the reservations AND social media teams.
@USAirways 8 weeks to refund this ticket - 0372389047497?!? - totally unacceptable.  Fix this or I'll put it on blast on social media and TV
@united this is it... Last time I fly #UnitedAirlines  you screw up every trip now will be stuck in ord and miss work.
@united I'm really glad I just waited on the phone for over an hour to be sent to a voicemail. Your customer service sucks. Nothing has been

@SouthwestAir for your loyal A-list customers it should be easier to get help and bring resolution to issues with your rewards program.
@united so? Found anything or just showing off? You do realise that the morning flight that you Cancelled Flightled was more pricey than the evening?
@SouthwestAir love them! Always get the best deals!
@AmericanAir was hoping for 8A if possible, for some frozen views along the way!

@united we showed up to our flight several hours early. Tried to call &amp; was on hold 15 min b/f call disconnected.
@SouthwestAir Any way that I can get a receipt for a Cancelled Flightled portion of a roundtrip flight? Used the flight voucher just need receipt.
@USAirways how do you get your aa frequent flyer number to appear in a USAir reservation?? Frustrating

@united correct date is 2/11/15!

@JetBlue Thank you for your excellent customer service - resolved issue quickly.
@USAirways the plane is moving and it's no ice. We are moving to the end of the runway to sit because LGA has one runway open.
. @USAirways It's been Cancelled Flighted. Your SM response is slow.
@SouthwestAir thanks for the apology. Unfortunately i have had one too many bad experiences and will no longer be flying with southwest.
@AmericanAir Define "sincerely". Your actions do not reflect what you're saying in a poor attempt to redeem yourselves on social media.
@AmericanAir two were non revs, right?
@JetBlue I can't do that flight. I need a Late Flightr one! I need you to change my flight. You guys changed it and now I can't do that time!

@VirginAmerica is saving my sanity right now: http://t.co/ELtBOLjUl9
@SouthwestAir i just recieved an email from your memphis station hopefully they have my bag.
@JetBlue I understand why ur doing it. But for someone who just traveled 2+ hours to get here early. Relax b4 flight etc. Adv notice maybe??

@united flight ua90 is taking off now after 1750 was delayed over 4 hrs 30 passengers to miss their flight to tel aviv
@SouthwestAir WTF, my flight was delayed and then I go to board and my boarding pass has disappeared from the Southwest app!
@united As a Million Miler I've been delayed plenty. NEVER in the amateurish way@SilverAirwsys does it. I'd be embarrassed to be affiliated.
@JetBlue what is going on with your BDL to DCA flights yesterday and today?! Why is every single one getting delayed?
@JetBlue I believe you have to follow me so I can send you a message
@southwestair Thanks. Yes I got through. Biggest frustration is that I'm no longer able to check in online for my flight after 4 Cancelled Flights.
@united I was, just very surprised it took over 15 mins. Never experienced anything like that on 1K number
@united agent split up my reservation? Now can't Cancelled Flight and refund credit for 2wks? Why
@JetBlue Annnndddd, I just booked my flight. That was easy.
@united had a different fiasco on my outward trip and was rebooked on to qantas lax-Syd. No FF miles show up in my account for that :(
@SouthwestAir didn't realize no clothes until at hotel - suggestions?
@USAirways @jhughes1025 grrrrrrrr. Couldn't book a flight via calling either :(

@united @bobwesson fair enough United. everybody is doing the best they can. Although that "slight delay" is turning into a Cancelled Flightlation.
@USAirways @AmericanAir flight 849's four subsequent delays destroyed my travel plans this evening. Looking to resolve this matter.
@united you mean like my mailing address and rate? By the surliness of my United "coworkers" I'm guessing our benefits aren't great.
@USAirways My brother &amp; his family stranded in CLT tonight bc gate E36 agent wouldn't hold plane for two minutes. Now driving in bad weather
@SouthwestAir I got a phishing email claiming to be from Southwest. I can forward to you if you'd like to investigate.
@AmericanAir is your website down? I haven't been able to check in to my flight all morning.
@united Been trying since 1230 to file a report.
@united worst flying experience ever and they tried to blame it on ATC?! I watched them load bags for 30min after boarding 45min Late Flight
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/MB0hVfqB1t‚Äù-see what ihop started üòë
@united Suck
@USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Ground power shorts again for the third time. Weary German passenger deplanes. Makes me jealous. Auf wiedersehen!
@USAirways @AmericanAir - Burned a lot of time and cell minutes working through this flight issue - hopefully we fly home in the morning.
@SouthwestAir #3252 Manchester-BWI being delayed for one idiot who isn't on the plane?! We've waited 2 hours for our window and may miss it
@AmericanAir So much for Status, EP and 1.5 million miles.  Revenue First class ticket and Im sitting in Coach thanks your rude CS staff
@VirginAmerica Have a great week üåû‚úà
@united needs to pay for my car. I could have been on my flight if 4 help desks did not say it already left. Shame.
@SouthwestAir I've never met my favorite band and it would be sooo amazing to win destination dragons.
@USAirways have had a medical issue Late Flight yesterday and need to change my flight today been on hold for an hour and still not through
@JetBlue You have very unhappy customer. After waiting 20 min on hold, rude &amp; uncaring rep has now frozen my acct. can't print bdng pass!
@virginamerica may start service to Hawaii from #SanFrancisco this year http://t.co/yPo7nYpRZl #biztravel
@usairways - thanks for the 5+ hour flight from PIT to PHX with zero entertainment. Guess why I have a quarter million + miles on Delta
@SouthwestAir Hi I just got a message that part of my flights is Cancelled Flightled. I can't rebook online and nobody answers my phone call. Help me
@SouthwestAir YOU ARE THE EASIEST AIRLINE TO DEAL WITH.. I LOVEEEE YOU SO MUCH
@United is it possible to upfare to P a segment where I have a GPU waitlisted?
@united : thanks! i will catch my conection! :)
@VirginAmerica you have the absolute best team and customer service ever.  Every time I fly with you I'm delighted.  Thank you!
@USAirways your CSR in PHL suck.   Flt 3883 gets cx'd,  i get rebooked to the next day?  On standby for 4011. Not hopeful.
@united I just received notification of in-flight Wi-Fi for UA863 from @flySFO to @SydneyAirport. Amazing!
@USAirways ok thank you we were told ground delay due to snow.
@SouthwestAir Why, when I booked via phone after calling the A List preferred #, didn't my KTA get added to the ticket??? Must I use web?
@AmericanAir check on what? Our broken tablet! See attached picture. #media #filmcrew #nbc #cnn http://t.co/Uq2ooPjPwg
@USAirways There is an error w/ my preferred status &amp; I'm not able to reach an agent via phone. Travel Friday. Need resolved - contact info?
@united @getmeontop 7 WEEKS Late FlightR AND I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY MILES FROM THE MileagePlus Gift Card $150 STARBUCKS CARD I HANDED OVER!!!
@JetBlue Vegas, San Francisco, Baltimore, San Diego and Philadelphia so far! I'm a very frequent business traveler.
@JetBlue right now completely pissed off
@AmericanAir on Feb. 15th your rep gave me the record locator and told me I'd be receiving an email with the itinerary and confirmation.
@USAirways the plane crew has been as professional and courteous as the gate agents were flustered.
@AmericanAir are flights from Pensacola fl delayed flight 3670
@USAirways is flt 680 en route to DCA or BWI after diverting to RDU. Your phone service  sucks and your website is conflicting.
@USAirways So no idea? Thanks...
@AmericanAir oh I will, AA on speed dial
@united I did not.  That's why I am VERY concerned.
@united please review and fix your baggage procedures at Dulles because it happens every week when my sister travels there on your airline
@USAirways can you DM me &amp; add me to the upgrade list for a flt tonight?
@united @VUSA_Australia I'm just an Aussie cowgirl lookin' for my cowboy. Take me to Fort Worth, Estelle says I'll find him there!
@united I did not, my mind was on getting to the next flight.
@AmericanAir flight from PHL to Austin Cancelled Flighted, headed to Houston, delayed, now have to pay to rent a car and drive 3 hrs to Austin
@USAirways flt 4439 is on the ground, but you don't have a gate for us at dca. Why is this happening?
@united my UA3426 on 2/19 was also delayed by 2 hours, stretching my trip way past the midnight, extremely exhausting!
@JetBlue Apparently not.
@AmericanAir The issue is the lack of consideration of an announcement made so Late Flight when the gate agent had been there for over an hour.
@VirginAmerica has getaway deals through May, from $59 one-way. Lots of cool cities http://t.co/tZZJhuIbCH #CheapFlights #FareCompare
@AmericanAir so great AA1103 sitting for an hour first technical problems now what?
@united I tried.   We were hung up on, twice. After speaking with someone, then put on hold for 45 minutes.  No resolution.
@SouthwestAir  If you'd love to see more girls get inspired about becoming pilots, RT our free Albuquerque event. http://t.co/rfXlV1kGDh
@united is the worst airline. Lost my luggage delayed my flights and has been very unaccomidating
@united common!! keep your paper work ready and don't delay our flights(#1585)and meetings @ChooseChicago
@SouthwestAir finally through thx
@SouthwestAir Have had a companion pass for a few years and my wife and I use it all the time.  Thanks #southwest for making travel easy!
@JetBlue you don't need to cut services, charge more and give a better flying experience. That's why I use jet blue in the first place
@USAirways No worries I was able to read @stephenrodrick entire book while holding. #TheMagicalStranger
@AmericanAir Please REPLY!  How do you mess up my rebook TWICE???
@AmericanAir we have 3 more passengers with me   There are two more reservation numbers
.@USAirways we have no choice but to pay another $50 to go to the airport in the hopes that we will be treated better by a rep.
@JetBlue Are we able to change to an Even More Space seat after we've checked in online? Have a flight tmrw and can't seem to change my seat
@AmericanAir @tennetexan Too bad there's only, like, 3 people on that team, then. Because this is next level unreal.
@SouthwestAir do you have a pair of tickets to the @Imaginedragons show in Atlanta?! I'd love to go! #DestinationDragons
@AmericanAir Again you guys are a huge joke and Cancelled Flight your flight for no reason. This is the 3rd time in one trip for me that you have
@SouthwestAir Logically you would think you check all that before you have people board. I could've drove home in the time I've been waiting
@JetBlue awesome
@AmericanAir nothing, you have done enough.
@united @RobBogart After I waited hours in the airport being told one fib after the other. Why can't UAL be honest with its customers?
@AmericanAir probs the worst customer service ever. Replied to complaint I submitted 6 weeks ago bout damaged bag... Not even replacing it!
@SouthwestAir how do I go on the scavenger hunt if I'm in Boston?
@AmericanAir No I was not given the choice by the rep Meelan (UK AA Contact Center) to escaLate Flight to a supervisor and had to book with change
@USAirways No flights out of Philly because of system wide tech issue.   @CBSPhilly
@USAirways I better get a free flight
@AmericanAir who do I need to talk to to get a full refund on my trip? Your call center offers no assistance.
@AmericanAir With snow/ice forecast DFW Tu pm-We am what is change policy on reservations we hold Wed morning? Any leeway??
@USAirways Finally back on board.  Door was closed only to be reopened because we need fuel. You think someone wd have thought of it earlier
@SouthwestAir I've had TERRIBLE service in three airports in 10 hours. Glad they don't care we kind of need to be home. #SellMyPointsSoon
@SouthwestAir I love ya but your bringin me down. An hour Late Flight leaving and now we've been sitting in the runway for 20 min üò• #fail
@USAirways unfortunately patience won't get me to my boat that leaves at 4 pm. I was on hold watching all flights fill up.
@USAirways Thank you for valuing my feedback. What will you do with it?
.@united I wouldn't describe feces sprinkled in your bathroom as an inconvenience. To help, you might find my baggage you lost &amp; return it.
@AmericanAir No worries. Don't blame you for weather.
@AmericanAir DFW GATE 16 to BMI agent seriously is beyond incompetent.  Never flying AA again if can be avoided #fail #pathetic
@SouthwestAir my wife had been in group A in prev. flight but got bumped for some reason.  Alone with two kids. At least put her in group A
@USAirways three hour wait and counting waiting for reservations on the phone. Are you serious!?
@JetBlue we have just landed, thank you anyway. Btw, flight staff on flight 654 were wonderful despite their full day and heavy load.
@JetBlue flt1533 to Carta what is goin on?! 1st told plane coming from hangar, then gate change, now no one knows wat plane we're getting on
@USAirways followed!
@SouthwestAir Thank You. We'll be in touch! #MoveAboutTheCountry
@AmericanAir spent $8 for the choppiest feed of "Whiplash" ever. #americanairlinesfail #iwantmymoneyback
@SouthwestAir Jackpot!  #legroom http://t.co/ZO2iceG4lI
@AmericanAir. For two days now I have been trying to reach #AmericanAirlines customer service to change my flight.
@united your customer service is crap.
@united well sorta....we r trying to get to Aquadilla, PR but only 1 flight goes there a day. All are booked. UA Cancelled Flighted our flight to NJ
@USAirways it MIGHT have went through. No confirmation. "Please wait" then same form.
@VirginAmerica @ladygaga @carrieunderwood  I'm Lady Gaga!!! She is amazing! üòä
@JetBlue flight was Cancelled Flighted. Do I need to file a claim for the $50 credit I'm entitled to per yr bill of rights, or will it just be issued?
@USAirways I need someone from management to contact me I was flying to a funeral won't make it now to add to my pain they want me 2 pay
@AmericanAir to add insult to injury, I have to go pick it up myself. Real class act! I'll stick the Delta from now on.
@SouthwestAir no one I call knows anything about it so I'm just wondering how to get any? #DestinationDragons
@USAirways no your not!
@usairways Seriously. This is ridiculous. I shouldn't have to wait a hour for my luggage after I land. #wtf
@SouthwestAir I told myself last time I would never fly you again. I really messed up today. Thanks flight 1802. Worst airline ever
@AmericanAir @brewcrewfan8 Is this real life, AA? Like, 2015 real life? You should be emailing/calling/DMing people you've inconvenienced.
@SouthwestAir Can I do the same thing as changing a ticket by Cancelled Flighting my current ticket &amp; buying a replacement online?
@USAirways @Sb5551 Um, WE knew this storm was coming, ? Is why didn't USeless Air?  Staff accordingly u idiots!
@SouthwestAir Twitter cust svc rule 1 Dont say IF we fell short. I just told u u did! #2 If u cant solve problem don't say anything at all!
@United Bringing your "A" game with premium cabin dining. Nice! https://t.co/zgOQoxjBQY
@SouthwestAir It was the usually excellent SWA flight!
@southwestair,  Your male flight attendants must being playing a game called Who can be the Bigger Dick to People. Flight 952 to CHI-MID
@JetBlue there's is nothing there because apparently I have to connect them for that to be true.
@USAirways flight 1808 is not leaving at 2:45 because we haven't even begun to board yet. Please update your website ASAP
@united my flight Cancelled Flightled new flight 5012 hopefully will not.

@JetBlue thanks!
@united thx off the response, finally got through the 45 min wait and talked to someone.
@JetBlue we need an ETA please
@united is that all that matters, not the fact that we're at a different destination, we were put through a tremendous amount of stress,
@united can you help me add my KTN to this reservation PLZ?
@JetBlue @EllaHenderson omg!  Wish I had a flight today!  Haha there's always next time!  Have fun at #LFT5
@AmericanAir Can I get some assistance? Flight Cancelled Flightled (today) from PHX to DFW. Not that I'm hating. But my job is concerned
@USAirways  ! THE WORST in customer service. @USAirways ! Calling for over a month to book a flight! #poorcustomerservice #usairwaysfflyer
@JetBlue you can 100% confirm that?
@AmericanAir I like the call back system. But thought you'd like to know it's not working well. I received three calls but there's no audio.
@united thank you.It's my daughters 13th bd party w/proj. weather cond, it doesn't look promising.Please assist with earlier flts to Cmh?
@jetblue I missed a goal On @NHLonNBCSports because of your Inept male stewardess. I should have landed already but I havent taken off yet.
@JetBlue Then en route to the airport the rebooked ticket was refunded.
@USAirways Inexcusable behavior by gate agent. Sorry isn't enough. #Flight850 #CLT-#BNA
@AmericanAir I am going to keep these tweets coming till AA does something...which I know is nothing..hoping I go way...not likely.
@SouthwestAir There is no way that I am getting back on a plane with your airline. I will be calling to get a refund. As I drive 17 hrs home
@SouthwestAir how about fixing the wifi!  3rd flight where it's not working. 800 series plane so not like it's an old plane.
@AmericanAir but you're not sorry enough to compensate for either the extended time or cost difference to an alternate direct flight, right?
@united Cancelled Flighted our flight, didn't rebook us on added flight, now have to drive from a Denver to KC....thanks!
@USAirways disappointed with your toll free number. Terrible customer service, my flight has been Cancelled Flightled would like to get home
@southwestair Amazing view on the approach to LAX tonight. http://t.co/a68d5fULmH
@USAirways get ur act together, start treating ur passengers w/ kinder, have more sanitized planes. Take a page from @Delta perhaps.
@united ORD Gate C25 and Flt 619-  remember when customers were valuable? Is it so hard to be nice to someone lugging a guitar &amp; carryons ?
@AmericanAir what about flight 1239?
@AmericanAir wasn't offered a flight out of PHL until TUESDAY so had to ask to be booked to Houston instead of Austin.
@AmericanAir no not yet. Waiting now to be connected to an agent
@AmericanAir My flights tomorrow were Cancelled Flighted, can't do anything online, and can't get through on phone. Help?
@JetBlue why are there so many delays to north east cities?
@united missed connection, wrong city, bags at Palm Springs, but not at hotel. I am seriously tired of being treated this way.
.@JetBlue process begins 6:48
@united Thanks!

@united leisure. Military personnel for safety reason R highly recommended to not travel in uniform
@JetBlue awesome, thanks!
@united DM sent.  This lack if customer service is getting ridiculous.
@SouthwestAir Looks like 'On February 19, 2015, we will open our schedule for sale through October 30, 2015' - know what time that will be?
@USAirways really, so what does that mean??? #usairwayssucks
@united Well the bar is set low! You guys are really good at the apology game! What will change? When will u guys learn?
@united hi.I am still waiting for the refund. This is ridiculous.Or u approve my tickets or u give me a refund.Please advise wht is going on
@united - tick, tock, tick, tock, it is rapidly approaching the next dream departure of 1:45pm. When is the next fantasy departure time??

@USAirways great. I just called your fucking phone number and she hung up on me
.@SouthwestAir received an error online and have been on hold for over 1.5 hours. Completely unacceptable.
@USAirways  My tweet gets me a response to email dmsc@usairways.com

@united can you not see the thread?
@USAirways Sadly your words don't represent your company's actions. Talk is cheap.
@USAirways on delayed flight from Phil to stt and looks like we'll miss the car ferry to at john where our lodging is. Help with housing?
@SouthwestAir she cut people off 35 minutes before flight time to check in bags, for a flight that was delayed 2 hours! I waited 8 more hrs!
@united awesome thank you very much for the help
@united Hello United. You should take care of your call center in Mexico City Office. Terrible attitude from the lady who was helping me.
@SouthwestAir Sure was,  with @Delta  looks like I'll make my birthday celebration after all.
@united flight UA1459 sitting at newark waiting for a gate, seriously??? #threehoursLate Flight
@USAirways Nightmarish customer service. Further to that, as an elite member, I'm appalled.
@USAirways your flight attendants are all jerks üê≥
@USAirways Best GAgent in a long time - Danny B. for US628 DFW-CLT. Appreciated how up to date he kept us during irrops. Super professional!

@united We waited 40 min for our bags after a 45 min flight #nomorecheckedbags
@JetBlue flight from JFK-SFO was pure awesomeness. Mint Class and Tim our attendant was the best! Other airlines, take notes!
@USAirways #NoService good luck trying to reach a human!  Twice sat on hold for over 50 mins...  #neveragain
@AmericanAir the folks at the Executive Platinum desk are great pros.  They understand my displeasure with change fees and switch to SW.
@united yes to three different checkers along the walk to the plane. Overkill
@AmericanAir Thanks, both airlines said that it is located at AA Detroit. Also was informed that it flew with AA, which shouldn't matter.
@JetBlue Are you having any issues with online check-in? My colleague and I are getting "Webpage not available" after submitting online form
@united No. SATO rebooked me. Just upset that my travel office had to fix this, and you couldn't.
@united you should spend all of the money you take for our tickets and update your planes! Each flight has a maintenance issue!!!
@united no worries - after everyone boarded, the cushions were brought in. Took a while, but they made it here.
@SouthwestAir @Imaginedragons I tried. üòî It's okay
Number or email? That's the purpose of sending you a tweet? @USAirways
@united 374 ORD to ROC. Fam came to see me at SNA. I'm a member, so is my dad. He used his miles for them.
@SouthwestAir I'm trying to get home to Nashville. I've been stuck in Dallas 2 days will my flight get out in the morning
@USAirways thanks for giving away my seat. Another fine job! http://t.co/r7ibqr4CYd
@JetBlue we were on b6 619 this morning from Boston to beautiful San Diego. We really were bummed the satellite was broken. :(
@AmericanAir I have looked and I was told it was in Guatemala last night. No record of anywhere today. I need my clothing for work tomorrow.
@SouthwestAir Thanks! Will do
@united can I get some help changing a ticket.  40 minutes on hold and counting....

@AmericanAir would like to talk to someone, please follow.
@AmericanAir Good morning!  Wondering why my pre-TSA check was not on my boarding pass this morning??
@VirginAmerica Really missed a prime opportunity for Men Without Hats parody, there. https://t.co/mWpG7grEZP
@SouthwestAir Hi do you know why WN4287 is already delayed until 9:35pm tonight? Thanks !
@united sorry to hear outsourcing plan. Boise is best staff/cust service in the country. #boise
@JetBlue Cancelled Flightling tickets for 3 best friends going on vacation and never told us #jetblue #fixthis #ripoff @ZKatcher @bretharold
@AmericanAir Would it be ok to send you a DM asking a few questions because i'm deaf and been on hold so long?
@AmericanAir airport to figure this out or can someone tell me now? Flight is from San Juan to San Diego
@JetBlue love it as always!
@AmericanAir I understand the weather issue but you can't expect passengers to wait 24 hours inside airports for whatever reason. Outrageous
@SouthwestAir every other city on your nationwide sale has fabulous fares. Why nothing from Buffalo? except for 2 cities?
@SouthwestAir jumped the gun a little Cancelled Flighting our flights? No other airline is Cancelled Flighting out of Louisville. You're ruining my vacation.
@united ...just called and lady at your overseas call center said she saw no note. I explained the situation...again...
@united we just flew with United from AUS (Austin Bergstrom) to Cancun Intl. Best flight ever! The 737's are not too big... Not too small!
@united I can understand that but to not have another plane available when there is a full day till departure is unacceptable. Phoenix?
@AmericanAir When will the old 777-200 fly ORD-PVG get upgraded?
@united #bullying in the #workforce not ok. Get gate agents 2 work as a team. 2 against 1 is never cool. #Delays #flights #UnitedAirlines
@JetBlue perfect! Probably need some coffee to stay awake during the night ;)
@AmericanAir airport and 2 extra nights for hotels and not once have I heard of anything from your embarrassing airline saying that you will
@USAirways I am a UK citizen. Is there a UK number I could try?
@JetBlue huge fan of great brands and people doing great things‚Ä¶ you guys rock happy to share the love!
@SouthwestAir I've been on hold for the last 2 hours - no progress #pleasehelp #stranded #whenitsnowsitpours #tgcyaLate Flightr
@AmericanAir she doesn't have Twitter.
@AmericanAir I understand. But why is this the only flight of the day not going out? Twice?! I'm now out of extra meds and diapers for baby.
@USAirways I agree but per the captain this issue happened before boarding &amp; we all sat in the plane for almost 2 hrs
@SouthwestAir I'm concerned that you will Cancelled Flight my flight out of BNA tomorrow am. Should I be?
@USAirways I have been rebooked but It has been handled very unprofessionally. Cancelled Flightations happen but the disorganization is uncalled for.
@SouthwestAir you guys held our flight #330!  Thank you!!!  About to take off from MDW now to Oakland.  Thanks
@AmericanAir Did the policy change? I've seen people with hamsters and rabbits before.
@JetBlue CEO weighs profits, flyers - @ChronicleHerald (registration) http://t.co/l2n0egHdgn
@USAirways Have him call me.  I cant wait to see if anything happens.  Your service really sucks.#usairwayssucks
@SouthwestAir do you have any tickets to the Atlanta show? I would love to go with my sister ‚ô•Ô∏èüôè
@JetBlue thanks for letting us know. Hoping for no more delays!
@AmericanAir @RobertDwyer AA doesnt charge any fees to change award tickets as long as the origin, destination &amp; award type remains the same
@AmericanAir please pray for us that our gear is not lost or stolen due to YOUR incompetent employees. #CNN #ABCNews #MSNBC #Photography
@AmericanAir Not giving you a hard time...Just looking for basic customer service after AA lost my bag. ETA on it's return, please????????
@VirginAmerica another perfect flight.   How come on your planes,  the sun visors can stay down?  Other carriers make you raise them?
@united (2/2) I have their name (boarding pass was in there, too).  I think they might really need this. Any ideas?
@USAirways Flight Booking Problems a flight using credit from a previously Cancelled Flightled flight. Can't get thru on the phone and can't book online. Help please.
@AmericanAir @justynmoro I totally agree.  You get the automatic phone attendent that goes NO WHERE and hangs up.  Lousy service!
@united, there is no good word for describing how angry and pissed off of a customer you have made me.
@JetBlue I'm sitting on the plane. Too many predictable mechanical problems.  Still onboard. This is getting bad...
@united If you consider 50 mins for bags @ 10:00pm on a Sunday night "as fast as they can", you should reconsider what you think that means.
@SouthwestAir  when you take my money and do not provide a service makes for a profitable venture for your company. #IsItTheGaryKellyWay?
@united I filled out the form but I haven‚Äôt received any sort of email confirmation that it‚Äôs been received. Is that normal?
@USAirways please stop asking me each week to place my bag in the size check #ITFITS http://t.co/AUrn07pWD4
@united ha, this happened 10 years ago. i haven't flown with you since.
@JetBlue What's up with lack coffee on 7:30AM flight. Was told someone forgot to load coffee onto the plane. What????? #INeedCoffee
Stop the madness "@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/Q5a7jtkI5K‚Äù
@united yes there is when you keep getting the same robotic answer.
@united ...she could not access seat map so she said she would note the upgrade in my itinerary and to call back Late Flightr...
@SouthwestAir surprise surprise more delays. Seems to be the norm.  Broken down equipment.
@SouthwestAir Offers Atlanta Unprecedented Perk http://t.co/nustgpElSf http://t.co/Be0B4K1Xbt
@AmericanAir You have a lot on your pLate Flight dealing with Cancelled Flightlations and weather tonite. Those are more important. I know you will respond.
@united also during the run I was instructed to do, I shattered my computer. http://t.co/oAflfr7WXB
@united Deep Vein thrombosis
@AmericanAir and @CVGairport get it together, perfect combination for delays and Cancelled Flightlations
@united It's the fact that an international should not be with out her bag and no sense of what's going on other than "maintenance".
@AmericanAir I'm trying to make a reservation with a &lt; 2 year old lap child. Don't see any option online. How do I proceed with reservation?
@united great decision making skills flight ops IAH bag makes a 10 minute connection and I don't, flight pushed early. Disappointed!!!!
@SouthwestAir Yay! And are dependents with ID (wife children) eligible to use this discount too? How do you use it over the phone/inperson?
@USAirways my flight is delayed so I missed my connecting flight. Stuck in Philadelphia over night and no hotel voucher? Thanks for nothing
@AmericanAir no thanks.  As I said, being denied miles that expired one week ago was the last drop for me; plan to avoid AA as possible.
@AmericanAir living in DFW.. Your Hub.. Hate having to fly to JFK to get to Ireland
@united "where we trick you into making us look popular on Twitter by being the worst airline" #wellplayed #jokesonus
@SouthwestAir luxury! Only 40 people on this flight. I'm going to get spoiled.
@united I left headphones in 2A on UA4689 from YHZ-EWR. It's a long shot to see them again. But worth a tweet anyway!
@united we got it, thanks.
@united correct?  What's correct?  Sorry I'm lost
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/vw2v8GVnGq‚Äù üòêüòë
@united be worse?oh you can't! delayed with no reason on the way to Lon;flight Cancelled Flighted with NO REASON less than 2 days before returning.
@USAirways I want my money back. Now we're sitting on the runway. After a 2 hour delay, waiting for the baggage to begin loading.
@JetBlue Let's just say #IDontWannaLiveWithoutYourLove https://t.co/i9KCgaxxFa #ItWasMintToBe #BestInClassSocial #ThankYou #Travel #Business
@united sucks.
Hypocrisy RT @united @gg8929 I'm sorry, we're not able to offer a full refund because the exchange rate is not what you were hoping for. ^KP
@united I understand why the pilot would get on the plane but why 1st class?  There were 5 empty coach seats near me?  I'm a Premier 1K?
@united how do you stay in business with such poor service? #poorservice #notgoodenough http://t.co/VO61LME5ja
Includes @KCIAirport ‚Äú@SouthwestAir: Inclement weather may impact scheduled service in. ReFlight Booking Problems options available: http://t.co/KeyrpFlHil‚Äù
@USAirways : We Suck -- And Pass the Savings on to Us! #usairwaysfail
@JetBlue @AmericanAir ah ha! I misread the end date as being 2014 not 2015. Thanks for clarifying :)
@AmericanAir 6 hours to get backs back after being sat on a plane for 4 hours to have flight Cancelled Flightled with only one small drink
@USAirways Thanks for getting back to me. I called that number earlier but no option to leave vm and just rings with busy tone
@united fails again. @SouthwestAir saves the day.
.@JetBlue 4 min response time. I'm impressed! I'm in. It's official.  :-) #trueblue  JetBlue gets social.
@united the supervisor on situation- Stacey took all our details-no claim number given to us
@united My flying United is over...sorry. The Captain still had 20 minutes of pre-flight preparations to make while we sat with no air!
@AmericanAir I'm home &amp; only 9hr Late Flight.  No thanks to your service centre - their plan involved 4 flight legs all across NA and 2 full days..
@USAirways see? No response? Obviously you think this "service" is acceptable. #customerservicefail
@JetBlue last week I bought a plane ticket round trip to FL &amp; just 4 fun I look at the price of them today and they went down! #nothappy
@SouthwestAir why doesn't your terminal B in LGA have pre-check? Makes me want to never fly your airline
@JetBlue flight 705. EWR to FLL
@JetBlue in the sky on flight 833 from BOS to SFO. Awesome crew! Helene rocks!
@VirginAmerica Sent a couple messages to the email you provided but to no avail. Will try again next year. Cheers.
@USAirways DCA-&gt;HPN, u r prof hostage takers.We stood on bus 2 plane for 25 min,now sitting on plane with no mvmt &amp; 1 announcement 4 &gt; hour!
@united calling that number was useless. Heading to the airport now to pick up my bags. this whole situation seems like a real joke.
@united i did but i got nothing from it. Just dissapointment =(
@united any info on delays at SFO tomorrow due to low clouds?
@united I will be calling customer service. 2 delayed flights today now, luggage misplaced, a disaster across the board.
@USAirways Looking for some help to recover an item I left on an airplane this evening
@AmericanAir Thx, someone picked up after 45 minutes
@united Flight 683 last night was #bad4business. Will be a long time before I recommend United to anyone.
@united 768 SFO to BOS and no internet it is 2015 what gives?
@USAirways What a mess caused by the computer systems. Flight 719 in 3 hours Late Flight and now no gate for us. Est 26 min wait.
@JetBlue when will the system be up and running?
@JetBlue Thanks for the personalized customer service! #cannedtweet #autoresponse
@VirginAmerica thanks! Y'all have some of the best customer service left in the industry.
@united Hours on the phone...hung up on...all I want is to be on a different flight (same day) that has an open seat. #greatservice
Stop. Please. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/EUl6sDURbU
@SouthwestAir flt 3867 crew  #OrangeCounty to #Denver is The #BEST! Weather delay but pilots just invited the kids to see the cockpit! #luv
@SouthwestAir you need to redeem yourself. I lost respect for you tonight #lostbags #filmjobnoequipment
@AmericanAir Supervisor M.Robinson just served a lot of attitude, Cancelled Flighted my flight out of spite, then put me back on on #crazybitch
@united Ruth was VERY helpful in re-routing us to Punta Cana when Dulles connection failed. Other reps- NOT so helpful.
@AmericanAir you put a sour taste on this customer‚Äôs vacation. it was joke watching those ‚Äúwe care thanks for choosing us‚Äù videos
@USAirways flight 2120. Please get us a flight plan already. How is this an issue in 21st century?
@USAirways this is more than having patience. This is not acceptable. http://t.co/N7pSuEJDC8
@united ... horrible wait time on 4348 to get a gate  ..shows total miss  management . Value customer time and respect thier sentiment
@SouthwestAir Weather keeps slowing us down. Not your fault. This is the 1st time a Southwest flight of mine was Late Flight so I can't complain :)
@JetBlue I would fly somewhere hotter then here. Puerto Rico here I come. Lol
@USAirways pretty sure we didn't actually take off at 7:10 http://t.co/vuxf4r4Unu
@SouthwestAir can you have someone call me back? I have been on hold two times today for over 20 min and still haven't gotten through
@united Did I mention that I was ON THE PLANE so is my luggage. My luggage that I'm not going to have for how many days.
@AmericanAir Delaney and Shawn at DFW showed exceptional customer service today. Will happily choose AA whenever possible now! Thank you!
@JetBlue Understood but I watched as fam heading to FL was expedited when they had 25m to takeoff. I am speaking at conference in SF
@JetBlue thank you for getting me home. And despite all odds I have reunited with my delinquent Southwest luggage. Now homeward
It's on me, @JetBlue! That's not what you said last night, though... :(
@united when I read it say ' in some cases' can you please define this for me, when for example would it not be the case?
@united 3 hour delay plus a jetway that won't move. This biz traveler is never flying u again!
@united free booze for the Bach party would make it better!  ORD--&gt;MSY #Delayed #Again   We will enjoy either way.  Thanks!
@SouthwestAir Just landed in PHL. Row 9 window cover on N366SW could use some LUV. http://t.co/WQZZtIemX0
@SouthwestAir want to pick up a customer from @SpiritAirlines sign me up üôåüòè
@united :take note of this great example of @JetBlue actually making good for an extremely inconvenient situation. http://t.co/t3Gnk2N7LD
@VirginAmerica For my Grandma Ella's 80th, she would &lt;3 a bday greeting from your flight crew! She was a stewardess for Eastern Airlines.
@VirginAmerica is that #thestarter??üòÅ
@AmericanAir hi when will your next set of flights be out for next year from Dublin???
@USAirways have been waiting in an airplane for a total of 3 hours to take off between 2 flights today...this usually doesn't happen...
@USAirways -1st x told no travel advisory-now TWO hrs on hold &amp; disconnected. Fl from BHM to Charlotte to PHL won't go-HELP!!!
Looking forward to using Passbook when I fly  @SouthwestAir in a few weeks!
@JetBlue this makes me happy. I hope these aren't empty promises.
@USAirways transferred 4x pleeeeeeeease help!
@JetBlue pls find my bag, I need 2 get home! Very frustrating. Hope my bag is somewhere in @NY_NJairports. Leaving the #jfk w/o my luggage.
@united IT-problems with the link? #3thparty
@SouthwestAir Horrible experience ever with airline..Have to reconsider any future flights. Customer service ... http://t.co/EczHcmM5vi
@united This is probably the least dependable airline in the Western Hemisphere. @united does not belong in Star Alliance, but SkyTeam
@AmericanAir Toby hates you lol
@SouthwestAir I'm really craving your pretzels, please send me some.
@united Hi, I read there are weather warnings on the East Coast of the US. Would a flight from LHR to SFO be affected?
@USAirways between 3 of us, it is costing over $1000 to get home TODAY for no reason... Where do I send my receipts to be reimbursed?
@united Why do I have to pay $ 17 for wifi with an international business ticket?  #pennypincher
@JetBlue had a potentially stressful situation in reFlight Booking Problems a flight which she diffused and helped make awesome!
@AmericanAir machines are broken, lines are out the door for self service, cust. Support, and bag check in.
@AmericanAir when will tomorrow's flight Cancelled Flightlations at Dfw for AA flights be posted? We are on 2424 at 7am from LAX!
@united Thank you for the cheese platter and abundance of entertainment options. Time just flew by.
Well @AmericanAir we won't be flying you. Rebooked on Jetblue. With credits (that actually work) it was free!
@JetBlue be flying soon to NYC on your airline, of all airlines I've flown you're still #1 to me üòäüòäüòä‚úàÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏è
@SouthwestAir sucks. Passengers leaving the plane to make room luggage, checking luggage and getting back on. Delayed flights to same city.
@united you guys are complete ass
@united another awesome new plane flight 1584 and extremely nice Captain Steve Connolly.
@AmericanAir @MurphyJulie it took them 6 hours to call me back. Then it disconnected twice. üò¢ I'll never get back to work
@SouthwestAir my bag was lost, and according to the rep they don't even know where it is, Please help.
@united Wow. What a deal. Again, 30+ plus seats available. Easy change to make a customer happy.
@SouthwestAir THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ACCESS TO #DestinationDragons TONIGHT AT @theTroubadour üòÅ @Imaginedragons Crying /dying rn #ripme
@AmericanAir that all AA is for USAir Elite members. It's one big disappointment in the way we are treated. #epicfailure
@SouthwestAir when will dates to fly go past August 7 2015?
@USAirways delayed I'm charlotte big surprise
@USAirways thank you
@SouthwestAir Thanks for getting us to paradise safely! http://t.co/KDzQcZlpyR
@SouthwestAir I thought you guys were the best airline...I've been on hold for an hour!
@JetBlue thanks so much!
@JetBlue that's not an option for us. So how can we help each other fix this? I would've made the change earlier if given accurate info.
@AmericanAir needs to get their shit together. 2 counter people &amp; a massive line. People need to catch their flights! http://t.co/4MQFMxeBXt
@united can you please follow for a DM?
@united just touched down in Miami - not too far off , Nicely done united üëç
@AmericanAir I'm not sure what happened to my USAirways status when the merger took place.
@united Thanks. Got it straightend out last night.
@JetBlue I'm curious to know how do you compensate for passengers missing engagements due to a two hour wait on the tar-mat to get to a gate
@USAirways so you strand my bag in Philly last Sat and strand me in Philly this Sat. thanks for the bullshit.
@USAirways Hi guys! Are flights 5594 and 3937 still on time? The site and app are both down and I can't check. Thanks!
@VirginAmerica @ladygaga @carrieunderwood Julie Andrews. Hands down.
@USAirways link didn't work via Mobil.
@united Please send me the link/email to formally compliment Irene in SLC on some of the best customer service ever. #PaxEx
@USAirways awesome! And yes, @UpInAirClaire is!
@JetBlue, why must you always delay my Late Flight night Orlando flights? üíî
@USAirways what's up with flight 5545 no gate agent or plane at PHX B18?  Nice customer service.
@USAirways depart from where? It departed PHX and was due to land at DCA around 8pm.
@AmericanAir @USAirways how can you have no food on a 4 hour flight 528 from Columbus to Phoenix? Starving and Pissed off. Can't eat Go Go!
@SouthwestAir no fare giving out clues.  In route now.
@united So publicly you asked for details on my flt. Sent you a DM, like you asked, and have yet (2 days) to hear from you. #unitedfail
@VirginAmerica @LadyGaga @CarrieUnderwood Sorry, Mary Martin had it first!
@AmericanAir over the last year 50% of my flights have been delayed or Cancelled Flightled.  I'm done with you.
@AmericanAir 1hr 46 min. Cost of flight change $788. Was $188 2hrs ago b/f drop call. Cancelled Flighted flight. Asked 4 refund.
@united. Worst flying experiences ever the past three days. Your airline needs to get it together. Lost a customer with me
Okay. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/6H5uEZH4cv
@JetBlue do they have to depart from Washington, D.C.??
@AmericanAir that doesn't really answer my question. Maybe if I provide more details you can give me clarification...
@AmericanAir rude gate agent by AA363 ORD-LGA just now. Seems to have a temper. Made me check in a bag that fit INSIDE the sizer.
@SouthwestAir nothing you can do to help us restore some barely-expired #RapidRewards points?
@AmericanAir five times at last count
@AmericanAir the food served on AA2402 was vile and gross.The entire cabin did not eat their meal. Survey the flight crew. Another gross out
@united since I have an international connection at 9am, I'm hoping for the same thing!
@USAirways Already filed a report personally at the airport, however they have no idea where it is even with a tracking number.
@AmericanAir thanks!!
@southwestair is your companion pass broken today? purchase.error.INVALID_LOYALTY_MEMBER_ACCOUNT_STATUS (SW900001-vyiL1XKlROG24fS-918j_A)
@united any chance you can troubleshoot check ins at @FlyYOW ? We're at 20 minutes per person.
@AmericanAir don't worry you won't steal my money again
@SouthwestAir yeah bruh its bool y'all niggaz just need to hire some more workers or something cause next time imma be forced ta disrespect.
@USAirways Never heard back, but this would help: Any chance I could bump up my flight time closer to 3pm today? I'm on flight 3960.
@SouthwestAir Southwest Airline is THE way to go!
@AmericanAir @British_Airways 2 weeks ago today i arrived in miami and I still don't have my bag, absolute disgrace!
@JetBlue thank you so much for your effort
@united Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER?????????
@united thanks for the info I already knew...
@united computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight info off the app. That's just ridiculous keep people updated!
@SouthwestAir I fly SWA a lot - ALWAYS purchase EB and NEVER past A30... Rethinking the SWA process.  Very misleading.
@SouthwestAir beautiful view flying into San Jose, CA this evening http://t.co/SxVaGbRTlI
@united since UA 1226 ORD-EWR is delayed pushing it into meal time does that mean it will be catered with meals in First?
@AmericanAir - Whoooo Hooooo just crossed 25,367!!! At my current pace I should reach 152,202 for the year.
@USAirways I recently moved and got a new license and when I booked my flight a months ago I used my old license do I need to change that?
@JetBlue it says it is now 9:58 you owe me
@JetBlue offers free flights for "Fly it Forward" campaign http://t.co/Yh1KZkYZrR http://t.co/wmO6tKqhXp via @usatodaytravel #travel #cause
@SouthwestAir Conf #8Q6MFD Finally got through &amp; told the flight was completely booked.  That would have been better info than advise 2 call
@united Do you have Bereavement discount on airfare as my grandfather just passed and need to attend his funeral this week.
@SouthwestAir So frustrated with my experience with #Southwest. 18 hours trapped in Denver bc of mechanical problems. #worstcustomerservice
@united go bankrupt again and transfer all of your assets to $LUV. That would be great.
@USAirways what happens to frequent flyer miles earned once merger is complete with AA?
@SouthwestAir horrible flight!
@united an over booked flight to start with and a red eye from lax to bos with no reclining seat.... #lastflightwithyouever
@USAirways question is why flight took off at all, now a friend is stuck needlessly in another city
@AmericanAir we tried. We are headed to a funeral in Cincinnati and your people didn't even tell us we could get on standby.
@united Brandi Zabsonre in Denver deserves a raise for bringing delight into a terrible travel situation. big ups http://t.co/TK3aOpdtSQ
@united When will email address/username sign-on be available? It's been a while.
@SouthwestAir is hosting an @TheAcademy party in the terminal in Atlanta. #peanutsonaplatter
@SouthwestAir @saianel You could have just said "We don't know"
@SouthwestAir @fly2midway 45 minute wait for my bags. Just what I needed on a Sunday night.
@SouthwestAir can you help
@USAirways that's understandable, my issue is with creating a new flight without the personnel to do it...I changed my plans to accommodate
@united thnx for the info
@united  why is it so hard to add in meal preferences AFTER I booked tickets? I forgot to do it &amp; it's now impossible! I even called.
@SouthwestAir  appreciate y'all getting the gate issue figured GRR. Plenty open gates, yet we sit and wait on tarmac
@USAirways wasted a day of my vacation after problems with not one but two planes... #waitinginphilly #flight838
@JetBlue thanks for the quick response! Fingers crossed the plane gets here then
@AmericanAir At what e-mail adress can I send your CEO Mr. Doug Parker a letter that he hopefully reads?
@AmericanAir done
@united passengers should have been rerouted to match the intended arrival time (even if you have to incur cost to put us in other airlines)
@united yep‚Äîused that twice; no case id numbers assigned; just tried it again-get screen that says, ‚Äúthank you for submitting your request‚Äù
@united is a joke.  Lots of angry people at IAH this AM.
@USAirways chose you for a flight with very time sensitive arrival And you drop the ball. What gives? CLT #667 good way to lose my business
@USAirways flight US1562 from RIC2DFW was Cancelled Flightled yesterday &amp; I was on hold w/ cust. service from 6-10pm EST...4 hours, no answer...
@AmericanAir Can you check on he status of my EXP membership card? Need the physical card to access some international lounges soon.
@AmericanAir Worst airline. You Cancelled Flight flight, don't let me know, I wait on hold 30 mins, told to enter callback for middle of the night?!!
@JetBlue I do follow you!
@JetBlue's new CEO seeks the right balance to please passengers and Wall ... - Daily Journal http://t.co/9bzqZQx8DC
@virginamerica Looks like a broken link for your assets https://t.co/OArDjjGrrD
@united I don't know my flight details bc I need to explore some options which I'm unable to do bc the site won't let me.Seems to be ongoing
@SouthwestAir understood. Just frustrating, you buy early bird check on the day they go on sale at 6:30am and get mid 'b'. Feel ripped off.
@JetBlue Thanks! I just sent a few DMs.
@SouthwestAir Dang, if only practice was an hour Late Flightr today...
@USAirways yes - tells me the only way to mod plans is to call the 4322 number.
@united provide a voucher for one of my customers and I will tweet about you all day long #earnedmybusiness
@USAirways - what is your policy regarding large-size passengers who cannot fit into a single coach class seat?
@JetBlue My #FlyingItForward affects just one small family of four, but it would make a huge difference in their life.
@united I think we both have the same status (nothing). I think there was a bug in your search system.
@VirginAmerica help. I was On  Flight  27 from JKF tonight. seat 7C left portfolio. Need it back!!
@VirginAmerica weather delays &gt; next few weeks ;) #JFK #BOS #DCA
@SouthwestAir when's the next deal going to happen a poor college student is trying to fly to Orlando instead of drive in August! Lol
@SouthwestAir One heck of an airline http://t.co/CyoOnZfTdC
@USAirways how do you give stand by seats to ticketed passengers who you know have a connecting flight ?
@AmericanAir thank you for responding rather quickly btw
@USAirways but in the meantime I'll be sleeping on a park bench on dadeland st.  Thanks guys!
@SouthwestAir is seriously THE WORST. I don't remember the last time I or someone I knew had a flight that wasn't delayed / Cancelled Flightled / etc!
Thank you, @AmericanAir! Much appreciated.
@SouthwestAir why so expensive to go to Vegas with stops in Late Flight June as I can get non stop for same on competition
@JetBlue your customer service agent Bonnie is amazing on the phone she deserves a promotion!!!
@united Missed UA1568 connection due 2 mechanical failure UA1543 ("uplink prob"). I will lose ~$400 in clients Mon. How can you compensate?
@AmericanAir I tried site &amp; doesnt allow me. Same reason why I wasn't allowed to board this morning. Will try diff airline for work trips
@AmericanAir is 2513 and 1555 on time or Cancelled Flightled?
@united Please consider letting flyers with no overhead bin items board/deplane first (after first class). Make sense?
@USAirways I have a flight in Saturday from MCI to CLT and there's heavy snow predicted in MCI. When will u allow for changes?
@USAirways changed our flight 6 times in 1 trip. Bumped to @Delta now &amp; having great experience. Never. Flying. US Air again. Never.
@USAirways http://t.co/AXRYeIWzh0, vuelo24.es, vuelos24.es sell too cheap MAD-NYC with USAirways. Are they trusted webs or is it a scam?
@SouthwestAir really this is getting worse as the day goes on. Late Flight leaving then had to be diverted, and now sitting on the tarmac in VA.
@USAirways Thanks for showing interest...3880 to Greenville, SC.
@USAirways gold desk quoting me $900 to rebook due to weather. Can buy first seat on same flight for $440. Why? On hold for 45+ mins now
@united I'm asking if you can simplify the communications- thx
@united THRILLED to have my carry-on checked against my will by two nasty gate agents only to see an entire empty bin when I boarded last...
@united current hold time AFTER speaking to rep to have tix reissued is 42 mins - why so long &amp; why not make this option available online?
@JetBlue waiting for a flight to FL for 1/2 marathon tmrw 4 charity. U bumped us 2a Late Flightr flight &amp; then Cancelled FlightLED IT. How can you fix this?
@AmericanAir my flt is at 7a tom. I have now rec'd notification that I'm going out from some other airport
@SouthwestAir I would but you need to follow me first ;-)
@united still waiting to hear back. My wallet was stolen from one of your planes so would appreciate a resolution here
@JetBlue i appreciate that. When i flew with you in January the check engine light came on right before take off. Now it is a computer.
@SouthwestAir I just sent a screen shot of the incident report.
@JetBlue everyone is here but our pilots are no where to be found and my last flight the plane was dirty that I had to clean my area &amp; seat!
@JetBlue And we are glad to see what is going on and fix! @ProfessorpaUL15: please DM me your confirmation # so we can check.
@SouthwestAir Thank you! I can't wait either :)
@USAirways shout out to the pilots and FC attendant(Eliz) of US 673. Super strong crosswinds during landing. Eliz did a super job throughout
@USAirways only to come home a day Late Flight to find out you guys have lost my luggage
@USAirways they have all of this at hotels. Still don't have my work folder or business casual clothes. #worst http://t.co/JIEYCat1Ek
@SouthwestAir has a beautiful fleet. What a perfect evening to fly! http://t.co/XMZ3Tf9Ix8
@USAirways on your website and on your boards at Logan it said it was on time, so we went through security and got to the gate (2)
@USAirways how do you manage to place a family of 5 into a plain with none of them sitting next to each other one of them being a 3yr old
@USAirways : You Make the Reservation; We'll Make the Excuses! #usairwaysfail
@SouthwestAir Fantastic! Thank you!
@AmericanAir just sad that even after spending so much on tickets all I wanted was for my wife to still go with her sister and no help
@AmericanAir It's not about weather, it's logistics. Why should I hold for 90 minutes when you called me? Why not get more desk agents?
@AmericanAir  zoom in on the sauce and potatoes.  This stuff is vile.  And I mean vile. http://t.co/m2PHoavRxC
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flightled flight from fresno then rebooked for LAX now flight Cancelled Flightled again and its midnight with no more hotel available???
@AmericanAir we knew it was not going to leave but we had 6 hours waiting... that was the hurry..
@united Nope, no more chances. Your airline messed up both ways of our trip.
@AmericanAir Any info for Cancelled Flightled flight 1046 tomorrow morning out of DFW? Can't get calls through to speak with anyone.
@SouthwestAir no had to rebook my flight myself and am about to board in bham.
@united have been waiting 2 days for my military bags from an airport 3 hours away from me. Horrible.
@AmericanAir LTALJX, from DCA to OMA this morning. All of the staff that helped me fix my problem were so helpful. #goodthingscome #thanks
@SouthwestAir - been on hold forever. My first flight was Cancelled Flightled but my 2nd flight is still on time - HELP!
@JetBlue Ok and in Dominican Republic what numbers?
@AmericanAir don't worry. I'll be sending a letter with what I expect from you for compensation. I fly twice a week w/you guys...for now
@JetBlue Something to think about when you are dealing with PEOPLE!!!!!  Just wrong.  No excuses. Figure it out &amp; expect the unexpected
@united what's going on with the mileage plus accounts? Login through username and email have been down for at least three days.
@united send someone to the customer service counter in person. DIA concourse B across from gate B36a.
@USAirways another fiasco at National. Forever from jet to gate on 8:05am flight from RDU
@united haven‚Äôt before and haven‚Äôt this time &amp; have checked spam/junk mail just in case‚Äînothing
@SouthwestAir lol I already am ! I am a card member as well too lol i enjoy flying with you Guys
@SouthwestAir The Fact That U See Black History Month 12 Months A Year Is Honorable! We WILL BE An Economic Base For Corp. Like U In Future!
@USAirways Stop reposting same autoresponse  That was return flight home #imateacher. Couldnt get to RSW  #neptune#waivethefee #notmyfault
@SouthwestAir  why are you the only airlines to Cancelled Flight all flights into BNA? Been stranded in philly for 2 days. Hoping to get out in the AM
@AmericanAir aa employees were rude and unwilling to help. 10,000 miles is a rotten cherry on top of a dog shit Sunday. #nocareforcustomers
@AmericanAir   What is that!? Why even bother catering dog food that no one will eat ? http://t.co/iFESPcBzTm
@SouthwestAir happy to enter your sweepstakes again #nutsaboutsouthwest
@AmericanAir there are no more flights via united when I arrive to DFW and my car is parked at IAH üòÅ
.@united Nope - had to rebook through Houston so I could get to Amarillo before 11pm. Stuck in SFO for four hours.
@united can't wait!!! 787!!! @tpallini http://t.co/oDlall5eDH
.@united just curious why you'd board a flight without a pilot. Seems crucial to the flight process, no?
@SouthwestAir here's a first..both pilot and first officer in galley during flight...
@AmericanAir flight 2470 tomorrow, have no idea if we've been rescheduled and can't fix online? Have to talk to an agent yet no one answers?
@united I sent you a DM as requested but have not heard anything. Can you address the issue I brought up in my DM and explain what happened?
@AmericanAir for our delays !!! I'm out of more money because of you

@AmericanAir your staff at JFK airport are discussing the way we we're left stranded
@AmericanAir DM me and I can explain the whole story. I should have been on an earlier flight not US1937
@AmericanAir @Eleonora7 good luck I've been waiting a week

@united 3 Gate changes in 30 minutes for flight to Roanoke and flight to sous falls in O'hare... Painful
@AmericanAir can I redeem AAdavantage miles on LAN flights?
@USAirways I hope so, too. Thank you for your help. She traveled halfway across the globe and just wants her suitcase.
@SouthwestAir been sleeping on the floor like I'm homeless and now delayed flights because the equipment isn't working! I have a job to get2
@USAirways next time you promise an ontime departure you should stick to it instead of stuffing us in this sweat box with no air
@AmericanAir Oh yea? That's it? C'mon buddy! Bring your special friend @united to the conversation - they seem to be doing NOTHING AT ALL
@united ,now you have Cancelled Flightled my wife and daughter's flt?? What's going on? Follow me so I can dm details.
@USAirways so basically I am stuck paying for hidden fees and being bumped to an inferior flight. JetBlue here I come. #usairways #mergers
@AmericanAir I'll give a reward for whoever finds and returns to me on Thurs when I fly back thru @dfwairport. I ‚ù§Ô∏è these earrings!!
@JetBlue their names are both Angel (seriously - how cool is that!). Truly FANTASTIC service!
@SouthwestAir A-list preferred line phone wait was 15 minutes. I hung up, not feeling A-list-ey!
@SouthwestAir  Wish you allowed http://t.co/0pDNtGBXC6 to access you site for awards tracking.
@AmericanAir the flight I'm trying to change is in 4 hours and I've been trying to reach an agent for 72 now. THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.
@AmericanAir served the nastiest food Ive ever seen yesterday.Rubber chicken in slime. The ENTIRE cabin sent their food back.FAs can confirm
@virginamerica the manage itinerary section of your website seems to be broken for me https://t.co/2pUJvCElNg
@USAirways No need for apologies just an unfortunate situation . There is no up date, I've landed but was suppose to land at 5
@united is there an email address I can reach? Too long for a DM.
@united unfortunately, that doesn't help. Just an automated computer.
@SouthwestAir when you're on hold with southwest for over 2 hours and it automatically hangs up on you. #iusedtoloveu http://t.co/tEFHpuWMdJ
@AmericanAir needs an entire customer service overhaul @Delta would never treat its customers with anything less that A1 service
@JetBlue unfortunately I was so startled and rushed, I didn't get the name, but will provide a description in my expanded email.  Thank you
@united or you'll Cancelled Flight my flight like you just did
@united  treats service members like crap never flying again with them #UnitedAirlines  @CNN
@united Some 3rd party service known as EZEE flights. A man, who confirmed he was born in India, told me his name was Steve Wilson.
@united Flight 512 had sime of the rudest flight attendants. I was run over by the drink card and had a flashlight dropped on me. #noapology
@united yup, it just happens way too often...5 times in the last 12 months
@JetBlue incidentally, Sheila at JFK deserves a raise because she's awesome.
@AmericanAir Thank you for the acknowledgement. The IFE didn't work all that well anyway so maybe time to upgrade to lower profile system.
@AmericanAir at gate c11. Your gate agents are turning paying customers away in favor of non revs
@VirginAmerica  for all my flight stuff wrong and did nothing about it. Had #worst #flight ever
@united Pay for my hotel.... I'm a broke student #help
@USAirways well this is about as worthless as your regular service.  A bunch of do nothings and idiots. #sucks
@united what exactly do you hang on this hook? http://t.co/ZHxOk07Aqa
@AmericanAir if I've booked an AA award on USAir metal, and space opens up on AA metal, can I change to the AA flight without fees?
@United I'm hoping we don't miss our LAX - ITO connection. Not looking forward to being stuck at LAX overnight with our team....AGAIN!
@united is it possible to add a Known Traveler Number to my ticket after Flight Booking Problems?
@united to Late Flight now, but in future flights, train staff better to handle emergency situations, and ground staff in Customer Service
@USAirways @AmericanAir what a joke of a company today reminded me why I never book with you
@united quick response offering assistance but lack of follow through - not really the service I was expecting
@USAirways Best part was hearing the attendant give a voucher to person next to me for hotel at BGR. Then my guy saying "we don't do that"
@USAirways incapable of seating a 2yo and mom together. Toddler in his own row #fail @CNN
@USAirways rebooked me after i missed my flight..never called me and i didnt check my email.  I (cont) http://t.co/uTfDhxa8pU
@united why? So I can waste more of time on this airline to get an automated message? Disappointing as always.
@SouthwestAir Thank you SWA and Shannon G. @LASairport (C22) for being a miracle worker! #awesome
.@AmericanAir just disappointed with the Flight Booking Problems process and add‚Äôl fees to sit together on a more crowded flight. Not impressed so far :-/.
@AmericanAir Not very helpful if my flight is already Cancelled Flightled! What about reFlight Booking Problems? AA has my email and cell - yet no notifications.
@SouthwestAir coming up on 2hrs on, still haven't spoken to a rep
@AmericanAir I sure hope you all can fix @USAirways. Good luck, their service sucks. #nexttimeiwillflysouthwest
@USAirways I just think if I am staying w your airline &amp; rescheduling a flight I shouldn't absorb a fee that is the cost of 1/2 my flight
@JetBlue's new CEO seeks the right balance to please passengers and Wall ... - Times Colonist http://t.co/NzDXRvszWv
@united Got it.  I am following the United page.
@SouthwestAir nice touch on the passbook integration!
@united working with Lisa J at ORD. she's working hard for us, but this is still VERY disappointing. was on 634 to EWR.
@united free hotel doesn't make up for such poor customer service and disregard
@AmericanAir @dfwairport you 2 together are the best part of flying!
@united yes we are in EWR and it was corrected but just the fact the it was beought up for us to share rooms is unexpactable
@united if you lost my belongings then BE HONEST!
@southwestair on flight 3130 and I paid $8 for wifi that can't load a website functionally except for your own live streaming. Unacceptable.
@AmericanAir can I send you my trusted traveler ID to add to my reservation for tsa pre?
@AmericanAir got back eventually! Was a rollercoaster. Once I got to the airport &amp; got to speak to someone things got fixed very quick.
@AmericanAir how hard is it to have catering ready to go?
@AmericanAir Thanks for the response.Tough night for all involved. Our flight got Cancelled Flightled as we started taxiing down the runway.
@united thank you. There was one here a few months ago, but none now. Weird you don't have a club in one of the busiest airports in the US.
@JetBlue isn't this something YOU should do?!  Why should I tell your crew how to do their job?
@AmericanAir trying to book a flight on hold- can't get through to a representative on the phone- Advice?
@united would be hard to be worse than last time but I'm sure you'll give it a shot
@united you should tell that to the staff at LAX then. I boarded group 5 at the very end of the queue as a Gold member. Thanks for nothing.
@SouthwestAir myself and 2 others
@AmericanAir worst company ever please do not fly with them I repeat please do not fly !! They will not credit you if you're delayed
@SouthwestAir Thanks I just sent a DM with this info.
@USAirways I'll check it out when I get to the airport. Thanks.

@united we were not given the option of using our United TravelBank in a recent Flight Booking Problems! Any help in using or recouping these funds? Thanks!
@USAirways Another great flight #FunFlightAttendants. Thanks for showing my dad wonderful customer service. #flt635 #LAX #PHX #SundayFunday
@AmericanAir your definition and mine of 10 min is vastly different. I understand the need to get off the plane for maint, but be honest.

@USAirways Many thanks for your reply! http://t.co/6CGFv02gzb
@AmericanAir well we cleared customs in AUH. I need to get to IAH after I arrive in DFW. Is it possible to retrieve my luggage in IAD?
@united funny, both my flights yesterday were delayed because of mechanical issues. Rotten luck to get 2 planes in a row with "issues"...
@SouthwestAir  Northern California coast http://t.co/nm4VNNF8Kb
@AmericanAir Horrible service @loganairports. Luggage got destroyed on flight and woman at baggage service was so rude. Didn't help at all.
@SouthwestAir Two delayed flights in a row. Neither one of them explained
@AmericanAir a worker just checked for ice on our plane using his cell phone flashlight! Really?! Come on!
@SouthwestAir @TaylorLumsden Taylor.  U gotta love SWA responsiveness at the@very least huh?
@JetBlue Traveling with two kids tomorrow (ages 7 and 4) domestic, do they need birth certificates to check in at airport?
@SouthwestAir yes, please #companionpass
@AmericanAir I lost my (basket) ballbag on your plane
@AmericanAir You have the worst customer service of any airlines I've ever encountered. Flat out awful
@VirginAmerica thank you
@AmericanAir due to gate agents I missed my connecting flight to Mexico City...not a happy customer AA- let's correct this
@AmericanAir ok thank you. What if I can't get a hold of someone to get a new flight?
@united and they were traveling as guests of a mileage plus member using that members miles. Great customer service.
@USAirways you should update your passbook passes with any gate changes.
@USAirways - is stranding your customers, not reFlight Booking Problems them, and then not answering the phone the way you treat Platinum members?
@SouthwestAir update 35 minutes into this pilot has turned off a/c. No longer freezing, but we are enjoying waiting for reload of all bags
@united The bright side would be keeping the promise that was made to me. Hope you're having a good night. Thanks.
@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flightled my flight out of BNA today. Been on hold for an hour. üò† #frustrated!
@AmericanAir These birds could fly to South America for example #Argentina
@USAirways And the number your agent gave me to call says you are not open? And the main number goes to a computer saying it is delivered?
@united Hate when I get bumped out of the seat I've selected (&amp; empty row) and moved to another seat (non-empty). #1K #flt803 #nonupgrade!
@USAirways still waiting #brokenpromises #notnice #neveragain #tellyourstory
@VirginAmerica completely awesome experience last month BOS-LAS nonstop. Thanks for such an awesome flight and depart time. #VAbeatsJblue
@AmericanAir extremely upset that your baggage handlers decide to go in my luggage and take my belongings

.@united I appreciate you looking. Can you compensate me on anything for my troubles? Still haven't taken off for a 10:30 am flight
@SouthwestAir Thanks to your team for dealing with Flight 1700 to Houston.
@SouthwestAir Not possible to carry-on and put in a closet/overhead? Had success doing that with other airlines. Thanks
@AmericanAir well I'm flying @JetBlue instead - for free! Their credits actually work.
@JetBlue id appreciate that. Would also you mind contacting the pilot of my flight and request that I be allowed to announce over intercom?
@SouthwestAir Thanks for making good on @PoteetTJ 's Cancelled Flightled flight.
@USAirways  I've never been treated this badly
@united thank you for compensating us for our 4 lost bags. We will fly with you again! #UnitedAirlines
@AmericanAir On hold since 5am. When no one can get to the airport, Cancelled Flight flight, don't make us pay huge fee to change flight.
@SouthwestAir Great flight yesterday from MSY to AUS!! Thank you for such great safety,service and beautiful skies!! http://t.co/X1EqYAHfvZ
@SouthwestAir DM sent! Thanks so much for responding! Your response was so timely, I missed it!
@united I'd hardly call going from 10,000 miles to 1,000+ miles a ticket cutting edge. About 1/10 the perk?
@AmericanAir keep up the good work.  Got me to my destination safe and on time today
@united why I won't check my carry on. Watched a handler throw this bag -- miss the conveyer belt -- sat there 10 min http://t.co/lyoocx5mSH
@united hey! DM not working. UA 307!
@USAirways still no rep can talk 3 days Late Flightr. U r asking me to checkin to my flight tmrw and my refund is being requested.  Deal w this!!
@SouthwestAir knows whats up! That #BlackHistoryMonth commercial. Just another thing to add to reasons why I fly with #SouthWestAirlines
.@AmericanAir how about connecting me with a customer service rep? I'd rather speak to a person than a computer. Thanks!
@united You know what the United Club needs? Power. MOAR power. Insufficient outlets for the #RoadWarrior (ORD)
@USAirways flight 623 den to phx: flight attdt decides to stay downtown and be an hour Late Flight so entire flight delayed, she better get fired!
@AmericanAir i want to change my flight for next week, they will still charge me. Waiting for fligt status
@SouthwestAir is now recruiting for Fall 15, Spring 16 Internships. 2/23/15, 5- 6pm @JindalCMC Davidson Auditorium(1.118) #JSOM #UTDallas
@united just got my lost Kindle in the mail! Thanks again.
@JetBlue I'll read this over a nice glass of wine right before I dig my heels into my next novel! Maybe travel is just what I need...
@AmericanAir awesome! Thx
@united My bag is lost and I can't get ahold of anyone that can help
@SouthwestAir Thank you thank you thank you
@USAirways My hubby has a 5hr layover in DFW fm the cxl'd flt. Pls help get him home sooner if you can! Any room on S/by 2 BWI or PHL today?
@united 3586 from IAD to BUF.  Incredibly loud, and like a third world 70s inner city metro bus.  #lowstandards http://t.co/m67WnBglXQ

@united I somehow think I'm going to be stuck paying for a hotel room in Denver without winter clothes on my dime.  I guess we'll see.
@united would love help getting there today. In #EWR now. Will take any airline and connections. Thx
@united flight was Cancelled Flighted after the last opportunity to rebook us on other flights this evening passed.
@USAirways Just spoke with a representative. Moved my flight earlier. Thank you so much for the follow up.
@VirginAmerica , am I dreaming? Did you really just open up a route between Dallas and Austin?! And does this mean Houston might be next?
@united no, ua 6 finally Cancelled Flighted after hrs of delay. The replacement flight leaves Late FlightR than this one was scheduled tomorrow. Not cool.
@AmericanAir @USAirways and our meals are also on us, because this company does not care about their #customers. Truly disgraceful.
@JetBlue your gif game is strong.
@united who is in charge of making decisions over there? Cancelled Flightling flight UA1150 was unacceptable. I should be in #Belize right now.
‚Äú@united: @rikrik__ What made you come to this? Can we help you with anything? ^JP‚Äù inconvience*
@united I see. Thanks for explaining.
@AmericanAir I really want to get home. Tonight, preferably. Please stop delaying my plane üò¢üòïüò¶ #AmericanAirlines
@united at this point I made it home on my own.
@USAirways I know this is probably a no but is there a way to get a cheaper airfare ticket if the flight is leaving in a few hours? üôè
@AmericanAir Uwon't allow me2make changes online, force me2sit thru excess phone wait times&amp;still insist charging crazy fees. Thats service?
@USAirways  nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay.
@USAirways Southern Hospitality luggage delivery service from SAV is AWFUL. Great @ delivering empty promises but not luggage #8hrs&amp;waiting
@SouthwestAir understand the weather, these kids need to get home! Nice kids doing volunteer work from a RI high school, please help
@JetBlue Hey friends! Stupid question - Can I split payment methods for a flight purchase? Example: 1/2 debit card, 1/2 BillMeLate Flightr? Thanks!
@united I'd rather have the truth about my flight than be forced to sit here all day. Trying to get home to this. http://t.co/U69fAfqhsF
@USAirways If I‚Äôm unable to use my departing flight can I still use the returning flight?
@SouthwestAir my flight at BWI is delayed and I will miss my flight in Denver, is there a way to find out if they will hold the plane?
@JetBlue I have someone driving me, it's best to get a wheelchair once I get inside?
@SouthwestAir Thanks for helping out! Class act, all the way... see you in the air!
@JetBlue wall separating in row 1. #safetyconcerns http://t.co/zTrDwV0N4l
@SouthwestAir yeah they told me it would be on the next flight. I drove down and it wasnt. I just drove down for a second time and they were
@AmericanAir thanks for the generic computer generated response. How about you accommodate your travelers instead of just saying sorry
@united roundtrip to London on @Delta ? I think I will! FYI that's another $1k you just lost. #moneynotspentonunited #unfriendlyskies
@AmericanAir Didn't really need anything. Saw your mentions are often negative. Keep up the good work. #gratitude  üá∫üá∏‚úàÔ∏è
@USAirways - thanks, I hope so. Maybe you can put in a good word for me? ;-)
@united the refund team is far from customer care courtesy they need training on work ethics. So it's like sir u r lying how can I help
But, are your flight attendants fucking tho? RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/wGYzTnjCXm
@AmericanAir @maxfitgirl29 next time fly Southwest...
@SouthwestAir done
@USAirways @AmericanAir I love you guys &amp; I'm gonna let you finish, but I've been on hold for 1 hour trying to book a flight w/ my voucher.
@united did our bags leave Washington yet? That would be convenient seeing as we left there a day ago. #UnitedAirlines #lostluggage
@united just wanted to let you know how wonderful Rosetta the gate agent was working flight 6457 Dan to Ase. Let her know she wasappreciated
@united flight 1219. My frustration boiled over after dealing with attendant. Her attitude was ridiculous.
@united @baftz rcvd promo if i booked flight silver status would be extended it was not dont have flier that was sent didnt think id need
@united reFlight Booking Problems would not have made me reach on time for my meeting. Also didn't wanna take a chance, Booked myself on @etihad instead
@SouthwestAir  I am following you now.
@AmericanAir pathetic to have your gate agents lie to my face when you are at fault
@VirginAmerica I love your guy's song! We're dancing to it for our high school dance revue
@USAirways is moving the plane to the end of the runway for us to sit on it for an hour and a half. They didn't even let us off.
@JetBlue as requested, here's selfie somewhere over the Rocky's. #milehighselfieclub http://t.co/A1ChOxKPJp
@VirginAmerica sad to learn you no longer fly SFO &gt; PHL. Hope it returns!
@SouthwestAir flying flight 3130 tonight at 7:20 from PBI- I have boarding position C-42. Is flight overbooked? Have funeral to attend!
@JetBlue planning on it!  Btw, excellent service and crew from DCA through SJU into SXM!!!!!
@SouthwestAir my trip is a month away...why do you consider it "around the corner"? Is that a setting I can change?
@united thx for update
@AmericanAir It says on you web site that u fly directly from ORD to DUB. when I try to book it says you do not. Have you stopped ?
@united - Group 2 line gets longer every week. Almost no one left for Groups 3-5 anymore. Time to make Explorer Card Group 3?
@AmericanAir overall lack of attention or foresight when managing flights.
@SouthwestAir it's not fun having a delay from Nashville to Las Vegas, but the crew at the gate C9 desk has been AWESOME! #patience #luvswa
@JetBlue Submitted, hoping for quick decision, tied to another donation we just received:Proposal- 27th Annual GalaOrg- Boundless Readers

@USAirways I been on hold with U for 40mins wasting my time and $ &amp; I don't appreciate it #WheresTheCustomerServiceAt http://t.co/phI2IfNjIT
@southwestair Your staff was really kind about the flight delay. Luggage? Not at all. Very disappointing.
@united Stuck in IAD going on 6 hours waiting for a ferry flight from Nashville that u can't tell when it will arrive?!! Ridiculous!!
Sir. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/F5IXyw8XyB
@AmericanAir @BoeingAirplanes I really would love to experience first class on that plane,looks stunning!
@united get a clue. I am a 1K/2mm miler and that is the response you give?
@united "Dear Ted. We don't care about you nor the Mileage Plus Card you pay a lot for. Bye bye. -- United"
@SouthwestAir He is going to file a formal complaint, this should have never happened. Please direct us to the right department.
@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flightled flights and asshole phone support. #worstairline
@USAirways Waiting on my flight right now, thanks!!
@USAirways 8 hour delay pho-mia, your airline is bad and getting worse, Foolish for american to merge.  You treat your customers like crap
@JetBlue That's not what I heard. Weather was fine this morning. Flight 136 was circling for some time.Someone forgot to clean the runway.
@SouthwestAir kudos to the crew of flight 1050 to GRR for making a very special memory for a sweet young passenger, and her Momma. Well done
@SouthwestAir -U dont have Atlanta to San fransisco in 99$ in the present sale, like u had in the last sale?Im looking for 2 return tickets
@AmericanAir @SeguineJ AA - this is a joke, right? That line isn't even accepting calls right now - they just hang up.
@SouthwestAir "...you in the 10 hrs we were hanging out there? Oh, no I understand things get crazy n sometimes 10 hours isn't long enough."
@AmericanAir Somehow between DFW and MIA I got bumped from 12B all the way to 41G on 2312? What's up with that?
@SouthwestAir great flight got us back on time!  Thanks
@SouthwestAir no HUMAN contact for 2 mths from @AmericanAir cust relations or refund dept. If ever a problem do u have humans I can talk to?
@SouthwestAir I fly back to Omaha for my grandmothers funeral, you Cancelled Flight my return flight and dont bother to notify me. Thanks a lot.
. @SouthwestAir condescension must be a quality your co rewards. Your tone reeks of it
@SouthwestAir thanks for responding.
@united 6377 and now they sent our green tagged bags to the luggage carousel. It's been one mess up after another. Bad day @united
@JetBlue why are you always so amazing! #jetblue #trueblue http://t.co/iIMTJxcvLG

@united another #DELAYED day. #Delayed outbound. #delayed inbound and now waiting at EWR for a gate to be ready. how is it not ready!??
@united (2/2) It suggests that if can't confirm cert at time of Flight Booking Problems, I should assume that it may never clear. Didn't used to be that way
@united 2/2 Instead, had to wait on plane from Ottawa that never came. Now I'm back home and have to try again tomorrow. Suitcase still lost
@americanair just tried calling. got a high call volume at this moment message and then it said goodbye and hung up‚Ä¶
@united thnx for quick reply but don't think you can assist. Our intl grp will be put to considerable inconvenience today.
@SouthwestAir I'm here @ChicagoMidway airport.  I've waited 3 hours for my bag. No one knows shit. Mgmt knows nothing.  #Very mad customer
@AmericanAir yeah, rebooked for tomorrow morning. But extremely disappointed to miss a wedding.
@united costumer service sucks! Waiting for a week for a response
@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine. I'm flying on one right this minute
@united Got a call. Bag is to be delivered tonight. Thanks for your reply!!
@VirginAmerica current bug on website shows ‚Äòselect departure city‚Äô when selecting destination city http://t.co/SLLYIBE2vQ
@JetBlue it's been a while since I've angry tweeted an airline. Apparently you read my mind before I could bitch. Thank you for the credit.
@AmericanAir once again flying AA4285, once again 60+ min delay because of mechanical issues. Perhaps you should consider maintenance?
@JetBlue Connecticut‚ùÑÔ∏è
@JetBlue thank you!! Miss you all so so much!! Is this the link to the blog? Or has that changed?
@AmericanAir @contactcej thanks!
@USAirways @caterobbie if that link worked most of us could take care of ourselves  please contact your tech people to get that working
@SouthwestAir Do you perhaps have a pair to the Atlanta show? #prettyplease
@SouthwestAir worst air line ever, you have no compassion of the handicapped
@AmericanAir no worries even though I was talking about seat assignment :)
@united your system is down and after being on hold for over 20 mins -Mia tells me she is going to charge a Flight Booking Problems fee?! Customer service?

@AmericanAir No one answers phone, delayed/Cancelled Flightled flights. Rude employees. You only get (I'm sorry, we apologize) blah blah blah. Bad
@AmericanAir yes but you did manage to lose two of our bags. Horrendous airline.
@JetBlue's flight Flight Booking Problems experience is pretty great!
@united it's been over 3 hours...at what point do you let people off of the plane? @FoxNews @CNN @msnbc
@SouthwestAir you have no baggage tracking system?
@united Do I need to use a Chase United Club pass for my 8yr old son, or can he come in with me on my pass?

@united I received my luggage that also looked to be left in the snow when I arrived. I'm asking for all 50 people to be refunded.
@united I hope your corporate office is ready to deal with the rage created by your shitty service and bullshit pilots. #UnitedAirlinesSucks
@SouthwestAir sign me up!
@united it's cool. I didn't need to go to work today. Or get home to make sure my house is ok in the -30 wind chill.
@SouthwestAir great example of customer service this morning at MSY headed to ATL. Alison and Bobbi were fantastic! Gate B8. Thank you.
@SouthwestAir I left my iPad on my flight 1831 from ERW to DEN. I opened claim 442998. It has so many memories on it. Plz help get it back.
@AmericanAir Thanks so much!
@USAirways would be less annoying if road conditions weren't getting worse with every min U keep passengers captive for no good reason.
@USAirways great job today from your team with a challenging weather delay on flight 1925 out of Charlotte. #travel #friendlyteam
@united bad customer service  to NYC a few weeks ago. Thinking of moving on
@AmericanAir good morning, please let me know if I will be able to get those luggage tags.   Tx!
@united Anyone there? Did you read my DM?

@USAirways with this livery back in the day. http://t.co/EEqWVAMmiy

@JetBlue busy due to storm but customer service should always be on point. More so now than ever #getittogether
@usairways we've been on hold for 2 hours trying to reschedule our Cancelled Flightled flight. Can anyone out there please help us?

@JetBlue Customer of the year? http://t.co/epqqONHO2H
@AmericanAir Will 2396 be Cancelled Flightled tonight?
@USAirways bumping people off a flight ten minutes before takeoff because the flight is overbooked #fail
@AmericanAir. All I get is an automated system that hangs up on me. I finally get a message that some will call me back in 2 hours.
@VirginAmerica I love this graphic. http://t.co/UT5GrRwAaA
@JetBlue Thx for the pointer, but Im good with the big monitor.  Any advice on who I should pick to come our of the Western Conf (NBA)?

@SouthwestAir Thanks for reminding me about my upcoming trip to Florida but you really didn't need to... http://t.co/p6r5rt5Ow5
@USAirways i understand that but i should still be able to view my reservation online....
@USAirways thanks for being so bad you make a two day train trip look appealing!!
@united I'm not booked on a 1:30 return flight..
@USAirways @JosephTReis Dont bother. They dont pick up the phone. Worst customer service going
@jetblue Vegas desk said JFK connect would b held 4 us and 26 others on our plane now staff at JFK says weather was problem. #epicfail
@AmericanAir it was my friend. She shouldn't have been scheduled so close together at LAX then not reimbursed. It's costing her 12 hrs &amp;$250
@SouthwestAir :arrived in San Juan early. Thanks for a great flight. LUV u!
@united because of the horrific flight experience, you guys have made me NEVER want to fly on an airplane every again!!!!!!!
@VirginAmerica  I flew from NYC to SFO last week and couldn't fully sit in my seat due to two large gentleman on either side of me. HELP!
@AmericanAir I don't want to waste any more of my time on your airline (you've already robbed 21 hours of my day) but I definitely will.
@united Delayed 7 hrs flight 5721 PIT/IAD, finally board the plane, sit half hour &amp; crew is at their hrs limit &amp; we deplane. Unacceptable.
@united I have already emailed but I didn't know if it was more expedient to contact you here. Please advise. Thanks.
@united sitting on UAL 683 - a comedy of errors.  UAL is incompetent
@USAirways I have been calling for 3 days!
@united the hotel you sent us to wouldnt take the voucher. Our flight was delayed, then Cancelled Flightled, then delayed again. 32 hours and counting
@USAirways your computer system went down ok that is understandable but the agents make it worse by not helping her or anyone else
@united it wasn't a comment. It was a question. But thanks for your copy and paste response
@USAirways now I am on flight to FLL, and told to take a train back to PBI to get my car. There are no trains to PBI!
@SouthwestAir I was told by customer service that only customer relations can extend the expiration date of my unused travel funds.
@united are you telling me that you are now Cancelled Flighting my flight ??
@USAirways Only water on flight 763 to DCA? This is the first time I've ever seen this happen. #ExecutivePlatinumMeansNothing #IWantCoffee
@SouthwestAir I don't want to be too whiny. We accommodated several passengers whose earlier flight was Cancelled Flightled. Our flight was very long.
@united A friend traveled via UA1470 today and never got their luggage. What recourse does the person have? Buy clothes and get reimbursed?
@SouthwestAir you have open seats on flight 4001 pvd to MCO @ 1215pm today?
@USAirways claims flight Cancelled Flighted due to weather at destination but Delta has not Cancelled Flighted flight on same route.
@united my husband is supposed to fly RDU to IAD then IAD to FRA leaving in 2 hours. You Cancelled Flighted his flight and there's a 1hr wait on phone
@united what's the hold up with flight 6475 from SLC to DEN??
@USAirways that link leads to a website that won't open on a cell phone.  Good job, shocking that your airline is folding.
@United I'm pretty sure I've got shin splits from SPRINTING through IAH only to watch my plane pull away from the jet way...
@SouthwestAir - I just had a great experience with your customer service team. Thank you! #LuvSW A-list
@SouthwestAir I actually could use a slight tweak to my return - not leaving here now til Monday -any way I can skip calling for that?
@USAirways provided the best service for me today! Thank you so much :)
@AmericanAir I DM'd you
Social agencies, this is why we can't have nice things. @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/QRxz0bGbtq
@AmericanAir We did talk with Delta for about hour over phone, and I got a number from Delta that they asked to give to AA, which I did.
@USAirways that's the 1st sorry I received from your company. The least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge.
@AmericanAir misplaced my bag 36 hr ago and can't tell me where it is. I've lost $1000 of stuff :( #AmericanAirlines #unamericanairlines
@JetBlue question, flying for the 1st time with my 16mont old son...do I need to bring anything for him? Birth certificate/S.S. card etc?
@VirginAmerica your Avis rental continue button doesn't work on your website to book car. Tried 4 times on phone.  This sucks!
@united can you assist with current flight status for flt# 1016 out of DFW tomorrow at 6:55am?
@VirginAmerica why are your first fares in May over three times more than other carriers when all seats are available to select???
@SouthwestAir not if its travel Credit you used to buy and it expires on the day you find a lower rate
@AmericanAir why can't you hire a staff that is helpful, informed and nice to it's customers?
@jetblue is the website down? Can't print boarding pass
@USAirways Baggage Team? Recording tells me my bag still hasn't been found. And delayed baggage link on web conveniently not working. #worst
@united @ThisIsCoach Every time my united flight got delayed. this is a big frustration.
@united how much longer will it take? It a guitar, not a royal commission!
@AmericanAir Do we get a class discount on your wifi? I will be flying your airlines at approx. 4 Am?
@SouthwestAir three hour flight to Orlando and no wifi? Uncool. #firstworldproblems
@JetBlue took forever for catering to get to my flight, now are very delayed. So ticked off right now.
@USAirways it's painful being on hold to you!! Really 25 minutes to change a flight!! http://t.co/ocqk0JFXuA
@SouthwestAir I am scheduled for the morning, 2 days after the fact, yes..not sure why my evening flight was the only one Cancelled Flightled
@AmericanAir your DCA baggage claim employees should realize a please, a thank you and an apology can go a long way #customerservice #DCA
@JetBlue looks like their inflatable car seats got left on the plane, so I guess they'll be back sometime!! #savethoseseats
@united Sure.  Follow for a sec and I will.
@USAirways From here on out when I can at all I'm flying @Delta. Since when is a plane getting stuck in a drift for 2 hours a weather issue?
@united Yes but unbelievable.  Should have a free fare lock
@united I wrote to you but got nothing.and I am out of US .It is very simple thing.Will ypu provide compensation for your delay?
@AmericanAir while listening to a delay message on my phone, another delay message was coming in. Get your shit together!
@USAirways thank you.
@SouthwestAir i cant look up my confirmation number at the moment on mobile. the email is no longer in my inbox
@united Funny thing happened, we arrived on our flight from Denver at the same gate we are currently scheduled to depart for Sydney at! LOL!
@USAirways why would you board ppl on a plane b4 its their turn to de-ice? Why would you have ppl then wait through the hour long process?
@united @UnitedAppeals @gg8929 What kind of hypocrisy is that? Only Cancelled Flightling tickets with bad exchange rate if in your advantage #united
@JetBlue Crisis averted! Flight #69 from BOS to FLL is boarding. Let's hope the new pilots aren't Clarence Oveur and Roger Murdock. :-)
@USAirways some flexibility on your part would be nice. This is why I love @SouthwestAir. They're flexible &amp; not trying to take all my $.
@americanair Help!  I need to speak to a live agent before I lose my online reservation being held.
@JetBlue I did not report the updated info - don't know how to reach them without a super long wait on hold at your main number.
@JetBlue, flights 1970, 1366, and 1552 will fly over after 1 am on your way into @BostonLogan - mind taking ocean approach so we can sleep?
@VirginAmerica Thanks for the lovely soft views! #travel #SAN to #SFO http://t.co/CnctL7G1ef
@JetBlue Update please on why flight 2601 continues to be further delayed
@AmericanAir Yo, could that be a catering truck before mine eyes?  Unmoving? http://t.co/ASW6QwUf1Z
@AmericanAir Yes. However, the seats they assign us that day are never together. I just want to sit with my husband! Why is that impossible?
@JetBlue you're customer service is terrible. #NeverAgain #flywhonotblue
@JetBlue I have the emails that they are on their way
@SouthwestAir your social media team just said "sorry". Thankfully submitting a complaint got resolution from an amazing rep who called.
@JetBlue If that was the case, why did your alert arrive so Late Flight? Four-hour delay? Don't buy it.
@AmericanAir at LAX and your service reps just hand out the 800 number to call. So that's not helpful.
@SouthwestAir still there? I was posted up in Downtown waiting for y'all. On my way!
@USAirways right on. Up. Up &amp; away ‚úàÔ∏èüåû
@USAirways They don't stand alone for me, I bought tix based on USAir confirmed flight. What good is confirmation if you change it anyway?
@AmericanAir I had it until last night, but because "severe weather" I could make the needed changes and now fair goes up 150 each.
@JetBlue JFK NYC staff is amazing. The #lax JetBlue... Sending an email with details but it was a disappointing experience @JetBlueCheeps
@USAirways checked into my flight yesterday and have been bumped to a Tuesday flight! Unacceptable and no agents to speak to!

@united you are trying to charge me 150 bucks because you lowered your award tickets and I want to get my hard earn points back, total BS
@united how can a plane that has been sitting in a hanger all day have numerous mechanical problems. Doesn't anyone actually do maintenance
@united ok it's now been 7 months waiting to hear from airline. I gave them quite a bit more than the 30 days requested! Terrible service
@SouthwestAir can you please make sense of the companion promo? How to we set it up?
@JetBlue Capital One and I explained the false fraud alert. Why did the Jet Blue representative issue me a new tkt if it wasn't resolved?
@JetBlue looking to for low rates bos to Vegas in Late Flight June for 3 kids and myself for a sporting event. Any deals or breaks
@united how about after 2.5 hrs at ORD another .5 on the tarmac + refuse to move me to an earlier flight you make it up to me? #iflyalot #bs
@united No, I need you guys to not over book planes. It's not a concern, I'll just travel with someone else moving forward.
@VirginAmerica What @dhepburn said.
@SouthwestAir - any update on flights in to BNA today?

@AmericanAir my flight 386 from Jacksonville fl to Dallas is showing Cancelled Flightled. What is going on?  Am I rebooked on another flight?
@united 2.5 hour delay, misplaced bag, poor communication, and the worse: unsympathetic, confrontational gate agent. Not cool!!!
@united your website is fucked up. Now instead of a $416 flight I should‚Äôve had yesterday, it‚Äôs $514 today. Thanks.
@USAirways on a happy note our 719 crew is wonderful. Can't say enough great things about our pilot. He's doing all he can for us.
@SouthwestAir A+ to the Safety Dos and Don'ts Announcer. Flight 651 from Midway (MDW) to Pittsburgh (PIT)!
@JetBlue Hey any chance you have an update on Flight 99 Hartford to D.C.?
@AmericanAir Chicago seen from seat 6A, AA 1620. So far a great ride! On to PDX! http://t.co/X4rsvAGIjN
@AmericanAir I DM'd you. Anything you can do?
@SouthwestAir  on hold with customer service; you may be quicker.  I rebooked trip for a lower fare.  Where did the difference in $ go?
@americanair new plane, #gogo, easy power for laptop, iPhone, just missing a good boat-style swivel cup holder for my #dietcoke #happyflier
@AmericanAir worst experience ever. @VirginAmerica all the way!
@USAirways it's not often that an airline is so easy to work with. I needed to change my flight time and the attendants at MKE made my day!
@SouthwestAir not as sorry as I was when I sat on a plane for 3 hours waiting for the engine to be fixed and THEN got my luggage lost, but k
@SouthwestAir and thanks!
fuck you, @united and your shitty fucking information http://t.co/scQUjbvsTA

@USAirways I've been on a music hold for over a hour trying to get my AAdvantage membership merged, can someone please call me ASAP?
@americanair I sure do. I'm running version 3.10.0
@SouthwestAir hey southwest! Can I see @Imaginedragons in Atlanta? My friend has never been there, loves them, and he is from Taiwan!
@Jetblue I'm so sorry I cheated on you with @Delta @DeltaAssist. Please take me back. I wore protection.
@USAirways @Expedia 7 Hours for my friend to rebook his trip to Korea after @USAirways Cancelled Flightled a connecting flight to Chicago = IDIOTIC.
@JetBlue flight 117. proud to fly Jet Blue!
@united gotta love giving up 1st class upgrade b/c flight delayed, to get another flight (also delayed) just to ensure I make my connection.
@SouthwestAir your phone lines suck. I have a dilemma.
@SouthwestAir Thx Ops Agt Rich Westagard n Flight Att. Nancy @ DEN Airport.Held flight 1027 n even saved seat 4 Bus Select #CustomersFirst!
@AmericanAir who's your pick for best picture? I don't want to board your airline until I know
@united That's still one day over my visa expiring on June 9, which is why I booked my flight on that day.
@AmericanAir Both pictures taken at the same time but which is right? #totallyconfused http://t.co/dvSLtQZKmQ
@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline without WiFi...
@JetBlue @jeff_hofmann @DeniseJTaylor @LaurieAMeacham Good one! And indeed, it's JetBlue's finest day in history!
@united typically once you get the problem fixed - then the crew expires - and the delay turns into a Cancelled Flight...
@SouthwestAir No monkey business we luv SWA!! #mdw2mci #homeandreadyfornexttrip http://t.co/2xJvUn66ZZ
@united JT thanks for your help I‚Äôll complete the form once we are back home
@usairways Ok thank you‚Ä¶I call from Spain to US for seating assistance!
@SouthwestAir Thank you!
@united still no response??
@SouthwestAir offering us absolutely nothing for our troubles either. Blames the @TSA
@united it's messed up to refuse to wait 10 min after united is at fault for delay but to leave early is absolutely disgusting.
@JetBlue Thank you Alicia!  #ExceptionalService
@united it's my 21st birthday and my sister is coming to celebrate but her flights keep Cancelled Flighting PLZ do all you can to get her here!!!!

@SouthwestAir weather delays aren't your fault today but getting to hotel with two soaked suitcases and no dry clothes stinks frustrated
@AmericanAir it's more than technical problems. #frustrated #answerthephone Res. on hold and can't get thru to use a credit to pay for it
@united stuck on Tarmac for the last hour. Can I have a beer?
@SouthwestAir So that's what happens when your power level goes over 9,000... feet in the air.
Great management of @USAirways twitter account. Thank you.
@AmericanAir is rude a hiring requirement at key west airport shaking my head
@united am I allowed to bring a duffle bag and back pack as my carry on and personal item? Flying out of NY
@united I interviewed yesterday as a flight attendant I was the last person the recruiter said they lost my file n came back to interview me
@AmericanAir I fly weekly with you and haven't seen one
@SouthwestAir you guys there? Are we on hour 2 of our phone hold at 3am bc of volume or short staffing?
@united Such as deodorant, shampoo, toothpaste. Seems like that would be limited to 70oz, correct?
@united Want to book a multi-city fare. Have miles for 1of 2 flights. An option to pay for 1st flight with miles +2nd with UMP Visa? Thanks!
@USAirways I fucking hate your customer service. I've been on hold all morning trying to figure out why you Cancelled Flighted my flight.
@SouthwestAir thank you. Please follow and I will send.
@united can someone at the airport in Portland, OR buy a ticket to be picked up and used 2days Late Flightr by other from Perth, AUSTRALIA? Thanks
@USAirways on hold for 1:23. All because they won't let me use a companion voucher online http://t.co/DPhQRgkdoA
@USAirways 2 days and 2 hours on hold the other day. Charge me double for flights and can't even fix it. Worst service I've ever had
@united UA 1706 delayed again - I get charged $600 if Late Flight by you - you say "oh well"
@united flight to RSW tonight -me &amp;  twin 3 year olds. A pilot who was in row by me stayed to help me get the boys &amp; bags off. Lifesaver!!
@AmericanAir they are giving cots to the people that did not get hotel rooms...that is terrible..
@USAirways  "please call Late Flightr" is not acceptable - but neither is being on hold for 5+ hrs #onholdwith
@united Why does it take 4-6 weeks for a new MileagePlus Premier card to be sent out? #stillwaiting #doesntfeellikestatusyet
@SouthwestAir What's up with the new in-flight WiFi service? Super crappy user experience. Miss the old provider. :(
@AmericanAir You guys are the talk of the Americans down here in Ecuador! Read this! https://t.co/5ON3KlzVMT
@SouthwestAir Learn how to give folks on multiple flights the same day boarding position at least if you can't give them  boarding passes.

@united Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! Your employees totally suck.
@VirginAmerica Thanks for a great flight from LA to Boston! Pilots did a great job landing in the snow. Can we go back to LA now? #seriously
@AmericanAir Got it worked out. Had to postpone my trip and pay extra though. :/ Not easy for a poor graduate student.
@JetBlue Every crew member I dealt with in Orlando was incredibly rude. I'm actually pretty disgusted with JetBlue right now.
@AmericanAir No. Had to Cancelled Flight my trip. Instead of a $25 future trip voucher, a $25 drink coupon would've been better! #WakingInMemphis
@USAirways can you help me reroute my trip?
@USAirways Worst experience ever. Unable 2 help over phone and told at last min cabin crew unavailable for flight. Never again #USAirways

@JetBlue ok should I start looking into other flights?
@JetBlue thanks. Home to MSY. TSA precheck agents directing people after photo until scan beyond rude. One grabbed and pushed children.
@AmericanAir Is there lack of communication/competition between the American and the Air by any chance?
@JetBlue flight 348 is a freaking nightmare tonight #sittingonthetarmac #delay

@JetBlue People kept saying it was due to weather but there were flights going directly to boston even after our flight.
@JetBlue if my flight was delayed can I show up at the airport with the appropriate amount of time for the delay or do I have to go on time?
@united I hope so too
@USAirways if you get my bag from E Gate to B Gate at the Charlotte airport before my 6 pm flight (Late Flight cause of yall) I‚Äôll ride US for life
@SouthwestAir I booked a flight on my phone and then never got a confirmation email. How would I go about getting that?
@USAirways your lack of customer service has shined. I need you to step up and get my lost baggage to delta. So they can return it to me.
@united it's almost like we're punished for living near a large metro area. EWR was top ranked for domestic delays. Not good
@AmericanAir To think that I'm a "Priority Member"! Wonder how you treat the plebes. I know which rewards card I'm Cancelled Flightling immediately.
@SouthwestAir I was not the one traveling. I was asking for my sister who was waiting on my nephew in Midland...flight eventually landed
.@VirginAmerica does that mean you don't have a policy for destroyed luggage?

@USAirways @_RobPrice  how can he try again it will be 5-6 hours before he gets help.  Contingency plans non existent.
@JetBlue  Not blaming Jet Blue.  This wasn't weather. Can't have planes in the air and runways a mess. That's a disaster waiting to happen.
@USAirways flying high thanks!
@united Thank you for that. Am I able to claim any interim expenses or is the cost of the stuff up on me?

@united Can I get a follow? I fly with you for Christmas.
@JetBlue Alternatives?  You have absolutely no respect for loyal customers.  8 years.  No more.  I'm done.
@JetBlue hi friend! Question for you when you have a moment.
@JetBlue such a bummer.  But I understand it's a business deal. Thanks for answering me!  Much less sad now.
@united and pick it up and just bring it on the shuttle. When I went to double check on that they said it was still on the concourse
@united please reroute Oregon Women's Tennis to Santa Barbara. There's supposedly another connection from LA.

@AmericanAir continues to win: I've never missed a flight before, but a nice little quiet gate change made it possible. Sheesh.
@AmericanAir any delays on tonight's flight from DFW to SAT? I have family members on board.
@USAirways strikes again...lost bags. And two of them. #theworst

@AmericanAir I understand a bit of a wait, but I called at 6:23 pm and didn't get a call back until just after 11:00 pm, that's not cool
@SouthwestAir already booked my tickets for August 20th-30th!  Can't wait for my vacation!
@JetBlue 653. Just for update that gate got moved to complete opposite end of the terminal. Airline is a disaster.
@united Well, It's LA and then a 2hr+ car ride to a dark Palm Springs technically. Maybe I'll get bumped to 1st class Den to PHL on Friday:)
@USAirways I asked for some reimbursement something like miles added to my account and was told to call customer service
@AmericanAir im still on hold...
@united worst airline ever! Staff is nasty, wifi down bags are delayed due to weather?? And now the belt is broken. Selling UAL stock in AM

@AmericanAir not only did you Cancelled Flight our flight from JFK and delay us by 29 hours, you've now lost 2 of our bags. Worst airline ever.
@SouthwestAir I lost my luggage. My birthday wish is to find my luggage.
@JetBlue Yep, still waiting for bags at #JFK. What's the holdup? Looks like we are the only flight that got in at this time..??
@JetBlue thanks. I chatted with a nice fella about it and he gave me the lowdown.
@USAirways it is an extreme inconvenience to make ppl check bags when there's a lot of overhead space left. You lie so you're not at fault
@united I am still in the airport waiting for my flight.
@USAirways @nanceebing 4 hour hold times at the moment...and counting. #disgrace

@AmericanAir yeah that's not helping. Having my bag shipped to the correct city the first time probably would have helped.
@AmericanAir understand waiting 2+ hours for callback on the exec plat line but when call dropped the agent could at least try again
‚Äú@AmericanAir: @nlrphoto Those are very beautiful photos!‚Äù Thx! Would marketing dept be interested in buying?
@AmericanAir robocalls me with another Cancelled Flightation. And then when I don‚Äôt accept the change it won‚Äôt let me connect to an agent. Just wow.
@USAirways 2 and a half hours on hold... Hope it feels good to be a steaming pile of shit.  @AmericanAir paid far too much for you.
@SouthwestAir for the win as always- saved my day and got me on a direct to Orlando. üéâüéâüéâ
@AmericanAir how does one book a ticket online and put it on hold?  Does that require that I pay for the ticket?

@southwestair Winter Weather for Denver extended for tomorrow by chance? Even to Late Flightr in the day would be super helpful.
@united @RenoAirport hi, when do direct flights from Houston to Reno begin?  Don't see any days in March?
@SouthwestAir thx - i managed to figure it out by trying diff confirmation #s as i booked. just annoying it's not readily available!
@JetBlue you wanna help out? How about you reimburse the money you cause my band to lose.
@AmericanAir he is at the Boston airport. There is a problem. The agents will not honor the voucher because one number is rubbed out.
@AmericanAir 245. I'm about to take off but one of your reps at a different gate was rude when I asked for assistance. Thanks, though.
@AmericanAir Thanks! Great stuff! I can only imagine how jammed everything is.

@united I need help with a missing bag.
@united nawww. United is my fave airline.
@united another fail for the United ticket agents in OKC. LESS than helpful and could care less about our problems. American here we come.
@united can you put Russell Daiber (on same ticket) as well into premium Eco? Appreciated!
@united See? We were told repeatedly that the pilot was Late Flight and kept getting Late Flightr.  After we boarded, there was a defibrillator issue.
@united did your super computer üí© ots pants? Lots of cranky people in line at CMH reFlight Booking Problems, delaying check-ins of on-time, direct flyers
@USAirways I spoke with a customer service rep who was rude and curt and transferred me to eternal hold. Sad. #badservice #mergerdisaster
@SouthwestAir @MichaelBColeman - thanks for making new direct flight to San Francisco.
@united to DM you I have to follow you and I'm not doing that. Plus they're no more options. That's why I had to fly with you. #epicfail
@JetBlue can't wait! I'll be the one who can't contain herself. üòÑ

@SouthwestAir Is my friend lucky enough to see #DestinationDragons live on his birthday? He's been a fan for years @thirty_lives
@SouthwestAir is that the same reliable system couldn't find my info and then said it refund my credit card ?
Meanwhile, they fucked my flight. @united: The festivities are already in full swing at the United Fairway Club, overlooking the 17th hole..
@USAirways beware,  Barklays bank has terrible cust service. Will not assist, only know to go by badly written book(in English).
@USAirways Thank you. I'll do that next time!
@SouthwestAir I love this airline so much! Thanks so much! The service is great! The snacks are amazing! Everything is outstanding thanks!!
@united Item (not mine) mysteriously ended up in my checked bag after a #EWR to #YOW flight.  Missing a black box? http://t.co/SJQEmDtQmA
@JetBlue @EllaHenderson Ah! Wish I was there! Good luck!
@JetBlue extra-speed line closed in Tampa. What gives?
@SouthwestAir Gary Kelly should be ashamed of himself running a corporation in this way
@AmericanAir weather is unavoidable. Understaffing is controllable
@USAirways can you please help me find my luggage since you're the one who lost it? Your customer service SUCKS.
@AmericanAir I've been on hold ANOTHER hour and still nothing. My Cancelled Flighted flight was supposed to be six hours from now. #Stranded
@united 4016 529557.   You going to transfer my car to me too?  Because it's at the airport you couldn't get me too...
@USAirways I never made a reward reservation becuase no one ever answered the phone. The online one I made got Cancelled Flighted and I can't change
@USAirways Cancelled Flightled due to maintenance. The plane was there for 10 hours. Get your shit together because there are a lot of people unhappy.
‚Äú@SouthwestAir: #IfThe80sNeverStopped, we'd still be rocking out to this chart-topping hit". What?  The 80's are over?
@VirginAmerica on VX399 from JFK to LA - dirty plane - not up to your standards.
@AmericanAir AND they Cancelled Flighted my flight and left me with no help to find a hotel to stay in. I slept in an airport for a night-_-
@united Please than Robin at EWR Premiere Desk for helping me get on a an earlier flight. She did the work.  Huge thanks.
@united with Karen and found her unhelpful and rude  called United at the time &amp; told she could board but Karen would not accept
@united worst airline ever after 70+ legs of travel I am officially done.  On time is not in their vocab.  I'm taking my premier status to A
@AmericanAir @MallowFairy And how many times, exactly, should we call and leave our number for a call back? Because that hasn't worked.
@AmericanAir we are through. I can quit you. I am. The nonsense &amp; lies are a colossal infringement you can no longer get away with
@USAirways - delayed 1851. Need an extra 5 min to make 1769. Would appreciate a little help again this week.
@USAirways cust svc just let it slip that previous cust svc lied to me about supervisors &amp; corporate ph#. $200 to change a $130 tix? No thx.
@AmericanAir this is the biggest joke of #customerservice I've ever seen from a  ‚úàÔ∏è brand http://t.co/XHSUUpHeZe
@SouthwestAir can you speed up your flight from AZ to Omaha? I need to see muh boy ‚úàÔ∏è
@AmericanAir now we are waiting on nitrogen for the struts and the airport nozzle is not calibrated so they are trying to find another???
@united Delayed due to lack of crew and now delayed again because there's a long line for deicing... Still need to improve service #united
@SouthwestAir BETSY is the BESTY! Gettin' stuck at #LAS might not be bad for most..but I want home! #homewardbound #betsy #besty #thankyou
@AmericanAir the service received by both of us was rude and well below my expectations of your airline. That is what's most frustrating
@AmericanAir @jameswester see, James, we only have 7 dedicated inbound phone lines because telephones eat into our billions in profits
@SouthwestAir you should have assigned seating, because now my cousin &amp; I probably can't sit together on our flight tomorrow.. Thanks.
@AmericanAir is there a probability that flight 1330 from DFW to DTW will be delayed or Cancelled Flighted?
@united thanks
@AmericanAir why would I even consider continuing your point program when I received no perks or continued bad customer service? #senseless
@USAirways tell them to get on that, please.
‚Äú@united: @RobCNYC See information on our boarding process: http://t.co/gBIw9ugFNm ^KP‚Äù. I get group 1&amp;2. Just no reason on 3/5.
@USAirways  big thank you to your ticketing agent Ute V at Dulles-Washington for OUTSTANDING guest service to get me rebooked
@SouthwestAir have a flight from Oakland to SNA at 7:30, and I asked if I can take 5:30, even there are 5 empty sests. Answer is "No". :(
@southwestair #netneutrality Nice to see you prioritize Internet traffic to your own streaming service over other web sites!
@AmericanAir don't merge with an airline that ain't ready for prime time and book your elite flyers on it! #NotHappy @USAirways #NeedCoffee
@AmericanAir already shared with them. Nothing done!
@AmericanAir the Late Flightst usair4603. Earlier 4591
@USAirways and I would have been willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and say we misunderstood each other until he went on a
@USAirways power trip. I felt completely threatened and unsafe and I am so angry. Derrick Bussey.  DCA. Would like to reiterate that I was
@united thanks for more timely updates.
@SouthwestAir please please please choose me to go see @Imaginedragons   #DestinationDragons
@JetBlue @hanneslohmann cool
@AmericanAir No worries at all. Y‚Äôall have a good one!!
@SouthwestAir Got it covered. Thanks!
.@AmericanAir: the best the agent could do is put me on a flight arriving tomorrow afternoon, with a six hour layover.
@USAirways No Problem - he was the only person in the airport who would help :)
@JetBlue I can't wait to hear back from you regarding the internship opportunity! üòä
@United thanks to Lea in the Chicago office for her help in switching our Cancelled Flighted flights!!
@USAirways your team was just terrifyingly rude to a young mother &amp; her baby trying to check in to a flight from PHX to JWA. Help her out.
@AmericanAir I tried to check in, but they redirect me to call in to @USAirways, which I also can't get into contact with
@AmericanAir flight BA1551 departing tomorrow (wednesday) - not Cancelled Flightled but how can anyone make it to the airport in this weather?
@USAirways sure did. I have carried this bag on numerous times on the same style plane. Planning accordingly apparently accounts for nothing
@AmericanAir first my sister had ZERO food in her cross country flight with no type of warning or voucher
@JetBlue Have a cup coffee and relax while you check out the New Deals and Promotions at Avon, twice a month at Doug @dcoadavon
@AmericanAir Well I'm showing I am still sitting at the gate on the plane that has not departed?
@AmericanAir thank you for the update!
@USAirways spoke with your reps in NH and PA. Very poor communications. Bags still sitting in Philly. TRAIN YOUR STAFF
@AmericanAir we will not be flying with you or US air again. The changes and Cancelled Flightations leading up to today's big finale is unacceptable.
@SouthwestAir thanks. What's your opinion on chances of getting in okay tomorrow?
@USAirways 2 hours and counting. ..what kind of travel voucher do I get for this??
@AmericanAir 767 seconds from touchdown at Madrid airport in April 2013 #AvGeek http://t.co/1yWXRfn0Gr
@united Yes there were PLENTY of seats available.  So why did Vicky Thomas refuse to give one to a million mile flyer?
@united - my son left his tablet on plane.  Am out of country and can not call easily.  Is there an email to contact?
@JetBlue I'm all set. About to fly. Not bad for a first date with a giant metal bird machine. She even brought snacks.
@JetBlue when I check in tomorrow morning for my flight on wens can I automatically add it to passbook?
@USAirways REALLY? Tried that already-got message not available to do. Next idea?
@JetBlue mission accomplished: gave @paulgordonbrown  a hug http://t.co/LT1pYKfvRq
@USAirways after 2 hrs of trying to reach real human, finally did and been on hold for 1:36 hrs for out of synch reservation.
@SouthwestAir loving the boarding to go to Chicago #KeepItMovin'
@united still haven't received a response. Please direct message me for my contact information.
@united never flying United again! Worst experience ever
@united I got an email from cust. care for an issue I had offering me a voucher. How do I claim that? I emailed back but got no reply. DM me
‚Äú@united: Looking for a reason to travel? #quote http://t.co/GGuIg3t28z‚Äù
@AmericanAir Right. But more than two hours Late Flight, and it seems due to poor communication, which sounded like it was annoying on-plane staff
@SouthwestAir 10+ people pre boardedOnly 1 needed a wheel chair off the plane... Was NOT the case boarding
@usairways Thanks so much for ruining my vacation. I really couldn't have done it without you.
@JetBlue why are you making me stay in JFK until 2 am or Late Flightr? Just let me rebook without making me pay more
@United @Skywest do it again!   I will now miss one or probably both our Aspen events. #Fail
@USAirways thanks.  If you have another method also that would be nice.  Appears to be a design flaw
@JetBlue Get me out of this 7 degree weather...here we go! #westpalmbeachbound  üåû‚úàÔ∏èüë∏
@united I am. Who knows where my bags are. Do I just wait around and hope they arrive? No one has answers, I have plans and no answers....
@USAirways I love you guys!!!
@JetBlue oh hell no. I'm not waiting again to get hung up on after speaking to 2 #rudeservice people
@united thank you! Much appreciation for your help.
@JetBlue That's why I love JetBlue! #truebluemember4life
@AmericanAir - Envoy Airlines is a disgrace to the AA family.  Nothing but delays and Cancelled Flightlations, week after week.
@united 4 people MCI to DEL. Preferably with Jet Airways EWR-BRU-DEL segment. Anytime in December
@USAirways of course! "Yeah, travel has gotten harder. Ask other passengers if they will switch" it's not the fact, it's the attitude!
@JetBlue no, they're too busy being awesome and trying to get us out ASAP. I'll deal.
@SouthwestAir JUST GAVE ME TICKETS TO SEE @Imaginedragons  AT @VelourLive ON SATURDAY. I CAN'T EVEN RIGHT NOW HAHA. THANK YOU!!!!
@USAirways I'm on vacation, This is the LAST thing I want to be doing. Is anyone even answering the phone?
@USAirways conf number FMJTYL delayed - any chance of getting an earlier flight fll to phx?
@USAirways 45 minutes on hold waiting to speak with an agent !! Come on #USAirways !!! Ridiculous #baggagelost #usairways
@united 25 min hold has now progressed to over an hour...919-675-0985
@united really needs to get its act together. Really disappointed in our change of flight, delayed flights, etc.
@SouthwestAir how about some sweet promo code to help me visit my family!!!.... Please!!!... Lol
@SouthwestAir customer service you shouldn't use those words wasted my time and took my money #BadBussiness #Theft http://t.co/63zaQ2lt8f

I hate you all. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/uTdfqF5WPA
@united Late Flight 2014 and 2015 are huge step towards decline in service, and your agents, not all, are as arrogant as ever.  #UnitedAirlines
@USAirways Hmmm. Did the flight even really exist or did they just create it last night to get people off their backs? #usairsucks
@SouthwestAir Big kudos to your staff today at Dallas Love Field for lifting everyone's spirits today with all the delays and Cancelled Flightlations
@AmericanAir looking for status of flight 1388 schedule for 5:15 am tomorrow morning, thank you
@USAirways told to work it out ourselves #joke #fail
@united very exasperating I'm having a difficult time with Flight Booking Problems as the error message says you're undergoing maintenance. Really, now?
@USAirways over two hours on hold to talk to an agent..then it disconnects me.  been trying for two days! Wtf! Hire some CSRs u make $ now
@SouthwestAir how come I'm not getting my points after I buy from the rapid reward shopping site?
@USAirways  Houston Gate 17 customer Service needs to treat people with respect. There are hardly people waiting! #chillpill #usairwaysfail
@united I hope not to see the same issue on my return flight tomorrow
@AmericanAir you have to run the engine to troubleshoot an issue before boarding the plane!?! How about another plane? #aa2227 #miatoiah
Sorry, @united. I accidentally popuLate Flightd with you instead of @USAirways. Can't wait 'til "U" are the only "U" in the sky. #NewAmericanStinks
@AmericanAir yep,filed a claim at Heathrow yesterday. We were promised a call this morning with an update, but got nothing.
@JetBlue Seems a few of my friends speak highly as well. Now we just need to find a decent priced way to go from YVR to SEA and overnight.
@united There is only one club at LAX  - in terminal 7 across from gate 71
@USAirways @AmericanAir Day 3 &amp; still no luggage Chkd http://t.co/MbLTALr4BS STATUS=AWAITING ASGMNT TO DRIVER Since yest 10:15am
@USAirways 2.5 hours Late Flightr and the flight has been Cancelled Flightled. You gotta work on your internal communication skills.
@SouthwestAir is my favorite airline!  I can't wait to book my flight to New Orleans for my trip in April!! :) :)
@USAirways But good luck getting there! Not cool.
@AmericanAir got it, so it's just paying extra not to sit in the way back. Awesome. Never again.
@united forces us to check our baby bag on overbooked flight complains to wife that we need to much for our baby.. united has no baby meals
@SouthwestAir About time...and just in time for my next flight Thursday.
2/2 @united You don't really care about our comfort, you care about profitability. That's fine, just own up to it. #unfriendlyskies
@JetBlue  I would go back to Aruba. I flew out of JFK. #bestplanesever #bestflightever
@AmericanAir pathetic service
@AmericanAir @sarahzou translation: we don't reinvest our mammoth profits into the customer service experience. 'Cause we don't care.
@JetBlue is flt 1202 delayed?
@USAirways can you please DM me, my flight has been delayed going into CLT which will force me to miss my connection to LGA at 10:05pm
@united sitting on the runway in Newark, they won't let the plane to a gate. My connection boards in 1 minute. @united hates us all.
@united my son is a passenger on flight 3710 from Chicago to Toronto. The plane came within feet of colliding  another plane and is stopped.
@SouthwestAir having trouble reFlight Booking Problems a Cancelled Flighted flight. no one picking up phones and your site isn't working.
@AmericanAir yes but you are still human I hope, dealing with all the horror stories people share... I complained to DOT. Everyone should
@SouthwestAir, a complete horror show. Flights bumped three times today, before noon, not how to run an airline. #cantblametheweather.
@united now been on board with no movement for 25 min...wow this experience just keeps getting worse and worse
@JetBlue Jan 5? That's not summer http://t.co/TpzhjX7Hbt
@JetBlue Please come to Indianapolis!
@AmericanAir originating at SFO and going to LAX.
@united you Cancelled Flightled my flight without notification?
@USAirways NOW they're not even accepting calls AT ALL! Come on.
@JetBlue It's not ideal, but it's okay. Better Late Flight than never! :)
@AmericanAir did you know that suicide is the second leading cause of death among teens 10-24?
@USAirways quick, let's board a plane so that we can sit on runway for 2 hours #clockwork #scareways #neverfails @AUmilo1
@united so you're telling me there is no number to call after being left in an airport because of a negligent pilot and staff?
@united no wifi on #ua688 #SF to #Chicago? 2015. That's all. Ps: This tech intro video is a joke. #EpicFail
@SouthwestAir Hello - been on hold for extremely long time. Have confirmation # &amp; can't get boarding pass. Have tried numerous times!!
@USAirways @AmericanAir Not providing pilots for your flights: is this a new feature of your merger? #efficencies
@USAirways I respect the stress of a merger but one rep to reschedule/replane 15 ppl who are already Late Flight? #youcandobetter
@united You're welcome.
@VirginAmerica Already checked in so the page expired :X
@AmericanAir Can you help with my Cancelled Flightled flight -- I'd like to book another flight...I've been on hold for 95 minutes and counting....
@AmericanAir the flight is not going to make the connection to #MEX #AA2444
@united #UnitedAirlines fill out form and never receive response? I expect remedy. We can travel another airline and Cancelled Flight as members w u.
@USAirways really nigga.. Ur a fuck boy
@USAirways  If you can waive a fee at time of Cancelled Flightation, you CAN WAIVE IT AT A FUTURE DATE! #usairways #ripoff #poorcustomerservice
@SouthwestAir what number can we use to all from outside the US? Thx
@USAirways @AmericanAir major issues getting out of Boston, but your crew has been exceptional. Let's see how things roll out in Philly.
@JetBlue thanks for getting me to Boston early for @TuftsEnergyConf "Breaking Barriers To a Clean Energy Future"
@JetBlue hey awesome peeps, what's up with flight 1159 from Boston? Delayed 3hrs?
@united nope all set. Thx for checking.
@AmericanAir I might look into that. My wife travels much more than I do. Could we both use the membership?
@JetBlue going to San Juan!
@AmericanAir how do you NOT do maintenance on #MD80 while it sits for two days? Frozen lines found after its boarded? Come on! #faail #mci
@USAirways we already spoke to someone several times about the matter and no one is sympathetic or will fly us home early complimentary.
@USAirways : Premier provider of missed connections! #usairwaysfail
@SouthwestAir I'm teaching new #travelers how to research, #budget &amp; #save for a trip today! http://t.co/Qll48r57ep
@united system failure again = bad trend.  Software projects are like flying an airplane; there's no such thing as an emergency takeoff.
@USAirways I have been on hold for 4 hours my flight is tomorrow do you really expect me to not sleep all night to stay on hold?!?
@AmericanAir we are off to Kax premium.  Hoping this flight is better food, TV now I know how to work it and service. Tnx
@united my flight was delayed due to maintenance in LIT and caused me to miss my connection at IAH to MSY. Can you help?
@AmericanAir Great, then tell me how you will fix it? @Suntimes @WSJ @latimes @nytimes #media #filmcrew #photography #cameragear
@united there was 20 min to departure, no one waiting. On being pressed ground staffer threatened "do you want to get to SF today" #fail
@SouthwestAir don't you think a 4hr wait time to speak to an actual agent is ridiculous?! My flight was Cancelled Flightled this morning! #Getyourlife
@AmericanAir thanks! a response is better than nothing at all {ahem, @USAirways}
@JetBlue customer service says since my wife setup a family account that she now can't join mine for a year???  Help me fix please.
Thank you for sending more details  @AmericanAir: They're pretty handy dandy. more info here: http://t.co/FvlxIRh1F1 #LookforwardtoflywithAA
@USAirways we haven't departed yet so let's not get too high hopes.  But everything has been on schedule so far
@AmericanAir please dm me
@AmericanAir just landed - 3hours Late Flight - and now we need to wait TWENTY MORE MINUTES for a gate!  I have patience but none for incompetence.
@AmericanAir Miami-PhL flight Cancelled Flightled just as I got to the gate. No one from AA around, no one on the phone. Awful awful awful.
@AmericanAir thanks for the info Is there a number I can call to speak to a person? It's going to take an hour to type it out
@SouthwestAir #worstthingever 2days Late Flightr our lost bag was fedexed somewhere. Do you know where cause we don't &amp; it was delivered somewhere
@USAirways @AmericanAir  nvm my bad it's been an hour and a half #thanks
@JetBlue you can do better than this. And you can do better for me and all the passengers. #flight108 jfk to pwm.
@SouthwestAir I was on hold for over 2 hours and my call got disconnected. Thanks a lot.
@AmericanAir  CXL flight. rebooked 2 PAX no problems. Thank you and everyone at AA for helping us all out!
@USAirways We've been sitting on this plane for almost an hour, waiting for it to be fueled. Shouldn't that have been done b4 we got on????
@united i need it there before she lands so she can have the EWR baggage claim file to have it sent but the employee has not droppeditoffyet
@SouthwestAir done
@USAirways Oh certainly. And now I have two $275 pending transactions on my bank account. Really happy that I was charged double.
@AmericanAir Airline trouble this winter &amp; not getting good customer service? contact http://t.co/aQjn4HwNaC  we negotiate w/companies forU!
@united Yes my flight was rebooked. I'm just losing trust in you if I want to get anywhere on time.
@JetBlue Thank you. Fingers crossed.
@united why are there no early morning flights from HNL to anywhere in the continental US? Example- Monday 4/20. Need flight to PHL
@united 3/10 disappointed in the service. Will be missing my connection after over an hour delay + cramped seats. At least their app is good
@USAirways unacceptable. You knew the pilot wouldn't be able to complete the trip. Wasted all of our time.
@SouthwestAir That would be brighter than all the stars combined on the red carpet tonight!
@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine Superb choice - SWA. I am a raving fan. They even take stress out of weather-reLate Flightd glitches!  #custexp
@JetBlue mechanical failure isn't Boston' fault.
@USAirways I packed a carry on for a reason. Thanks for making me check it. I hoped for better customer service in CLE also. #nothappy
@AmericanAir I love the service and cheap upgrades American Provides! One of the best airlines ever! good food, good seats, amazing thanks!
@VirginAmerica is the website down?

@AmericanAir Just landed - crew couldn't have been more gracious or accommodating. Although a long delay I appreciate your prompt response!
@JetBlue awesome, thanks! on hold now.
@united thanks
@USAirways Have a 6:05pm flight out of PHL Sat, 2/21. Snow expected. Are we able to switch to an earlier flight without penalty?

@AmericanAir has Cancelled Flighted their last 3 flight into SHV tonight &amp; all flights for tomorrow, Feb. 23, out of SHV and multiple flight into SHV.
@AmericanAir I was suppose to be in FL 4 hours ago. And I'm not. I've been waiting for hours this is just ridiculous
@SouthwestAir my flight is Cancelled Flightled due to weather. What next ?
@AmericanAir My father loved working for you as well as PanAm

@VirginAmerica Man of steel flies to more cities though...and with more frequency too.
@JetBlue flying w/ infant for the 1st time, can I bring a canister of powder formula for a carry on and/or use my plastic formula divider?

What can I say other than when it comes to my #BrandLoveAffair w/ @jetblue ur my #soulandinspiration https://t.co/IGkoGyWksr #umosaicmecrazy
@AmericanAir She was at gate on time though, they made her cry, and made a scene for 10 mins instead of boarding her. Plane still outside.
@united it's 9:56, and the desk attendant stated we would "sit awhile" until given the all clear. Lack of communication seems to the norm.
@united Pay for a cab back to the airport to show baggage dept. my wet shirts and suit is not a viable option. 2nd time this has happened!!
@AmericanAir I can't get an operator after an hour's worth of calls to Cancelled Flight a delayed flight. Automated system doesn't go beyond message.

@SouthwestAir okay thank you :), also I did get a tweet earlier about 1.5 hrs ago saying I won &amp; should send a DM but then it was deleted?
@JetBlue no. Did not catch his name. I am sure Jason will know.

@SouthwestAir when are you releasing your flights for September? Just found out you fly direct lbb to las! So excited! #tripofalifetime
@SouthwestAir oh my god thank you so much!!! I just sent you a DM

@united Okay thank you
@united then why do you bother responding? Your customer service is THE WORST. Never using you guys again.
@united Which just speaks to basically the worst designed web system ever.
@JetBlue  Alright I hope. My JetBlue app is showing a change in my seats and online shows an a320.  Don't want any surprises
@VirginAmerica the CSS on your site is a 404 right now, please fix. Site unusable.
@united flight 86 LAX-IAD, back rows NOT CLEANED prior to boarding. How gross is that to find used tissues in your seat?  Please.
@united Doumented via link. However, now that it has been over four months with no response, what do you suggest? Or shall I not expect one?
@JetBlue wants Customs at Long Beach Airport for future international flights. By @EricBradleyPT http://t.co/J6Hb4JDvER cc: @BrianSumers

@JetBlue where is the "award winning service"?
@JetBlue I love you

@united lax29108m make it happen please else on a cruise with no luggage tomorrow

@USAirways after a grt flight to PHX last week,  tonight was terrible. 2.5 hours taxing and you give us water and crackers to compensate.

@USAirways had baggage lost last night, no call from us airways and no bags and nobody answering phone #badcustomersrvice #whereismybag
@AmericanAir I bet they do! I'm sure they have some form of wear and tear on their skin. I hope they will survive the rest of the winter xxx
@USAirways worst airline ever....left without luggage for 7 days, submit $700 expenses and they offer a refund of $297? #badservice
@USAirways I keep thinking this is a massive practical joke and someone is gonna appear out of thin air and take me to Reno tonight.

@united mechanical issues causes delay and connecting plane at ORD only needed to wait 10 min for them. Refused and left early instead. Wtf
@SouthwestAir your employees at BWI have been amazing!
@united Not sure what happened @ MSP yesterday, but VERY UNHAPPY my bag was not only delayed, but sat at MSP for 8 hrs b4 delivery @ 2:30 am

@united please help! Left my iPad Air 2 on my flight from NYC to Paris yesterday and can‚Äôt get in touch with anyone locally. What to do?
@united airlines abuse your expensive video equipment and overcharge you for the privilege http://t.co/SdyLuKR7pt via @robthecameraman
@united only thing confusing me is why I lost priority boarding? I'm a mileage plus card member üòî
@united over an hour stuck and still not off the plane. Total failure by you and your partners in ensuring the best customer experience.
@united Thank you! Off to LA to do something very special.
@USAirways flight 2031, worst experience we've ever had on a flight. Regretting opening their air miles card #hotterandlongerthanhell

@SouthwestAir or you could send me a DM.
@usairways I've called for 3 days and can't get thru. is there some secret method i can use that doesn't result in you hanging up on me?

@AmericanAir an overzealous stewardess prevented us from bringing in a car seat! #worstflight!
@VirginAmerica please provide status for flight 769.  I cant imagine it's on time as the Web indicates  dude to weather here and/or Dallas
@JetBlue thank you thank you!  I finally set up the jetblue app!  Yay!
@JetBlue if my flight says delayed with estimated departure listed, can I arrive at airport Late Flightr?
@americanair the best is your 800 message saying to use website and your website is saying you need to call.  If you don't answer, #hardtodo
‚Äú@JetBlue: @2littlebirds Beautiful shot.. Thanks for sharing. Using #FlyFi to post? ;)‚Äù Your welcome! Not on this flight. It was a quickie;)
@AmericanAir Thank you for the quick customer service today. #RefundProcedureNotTooPainful I know that Winter Weather is not your fault.

@USAirways yeah, the mark was like a mile back. Also we're an hour Late Flight. So thanks a ton for the great service today.
@united #epicfail on #CX as flight from Frankfurt to San Francisco now going to Chicago as flight crew out of hours due to de-icing delay
@USAirways if my flight, 4035, is delayed, what time do I have to arrive at BHM?
@USAirways I have run out of patience.. We are sitting in a bus without air in front of plane and there is no communication from anyone40min
@AmericanAir Absolutely!
@JetBlue I had 2 fight 2 get a credit for the value of my bag but I got it. #skytrax #jetblue #corpgreed #nevertakeno http://t.co/6MBVJFlpBM
@VirginAmerica You guys charged me $100 to reschedule a flight that was then Cancelled Flighted and are now refusing to refund it. What's the deal?
@AmericanAir #last #flight #ever on #AA. You botched this weather delay to the point of absurdity. I'd pay more to fly @Delta
@united Just let the employees know that good service and a kind attitude towards customers is vital in this kind of business. Thanks
@united this is besides the fact that one week ago you delayed me by 18 hours. i am not impressed at all.
@united Club in Denver is dope üëå
@JetBlue hi guys, do you have a general enquires email address please? Thanks David.
@AmericanAir I had to purchase a ticket that I never would have had to buy had the flight not been Cancelled Flightled. Terrible customer service.
@AmericanAir Really?They closed the gate at 10:30 instead of40.I got there at 10:39. If u wudda put in my ktn like I asked, I wudda made it.
@AmericanAir You're clueless. A kind rez agnt contacted USAir 4me around midnite, told them what to do. If not that I'd have missed funeral.
@USAirways #PHL why does it take an hour to offload bags, especially after taking 30+ min to get a jetway to get off plane after landing?
@AmericanAir Not necessary.  I am confident the excellent in-flight staff will make the appropriate report.
@AmericanAir thanks to Jacqueline in CLT for cleaning up @amexserve and @USAirways mess!!! Awesome service
@SouthwestAir you guys are awesome... #dontchangeathing #luv
@AmericanAir I'll DM you.
@JetBlue  I'm at 4:05  will be nasty in Boston. Have family driving 90 min to pick me up from Erie think flight - what if Cancelled Flighted?
@SouthwestAir I have been loyal to Southwest from the beginning but very unhappy about your devaluation.
@JetBlue ....you haven't got me just yetCan a 1 way LAX-NYC cost me under 190?
@USAirways US 728 returned to gate to get "MEL" sticker. Oh, look. We heard from pilot! No clue what an MEL sticker is. Anyone?
@USAirways 8am flight to mco canld &amp; resch 1:30.If we opt for 8 am depart tom will us air allow cng return day from sat to sun w/o penalty?
@united ok thanks! Where are you counters located? And how Late Flight are they open?
@VirginAmerica why can't you supp the biz traveler like @SouthwestAir  and have customer service like @JetBlue #neverflyvirginforbusiness
@JetBlue that's where we all get on the same page. Cancelled Flighted it 45 mins ago. @delta @SouthwestAir help flights from @tfgreenairport to MCO?
@AmericanAir FINALLY called me back... BUT HASN'T SPOKEN TO ME.  Like the worst prank call EVER!!
@AmericanAir @cjdjpdx not a valid response in 2015 for a multinational corp whose profits are measured in billions. Stop understaffing!
@USAirways When I check online it states status closed. What does this mean? As I have yet been able to reach a live person...
@JetBlue is gettin fancy! #Mint #LieFlat Nice work on the menu @Saxonandparole #LobsterMac #BloodyMary #JetSetter http://t.co/zf5wjgtXzT
@united - you sure missed the mark on tonight's redeye from LAX to Chicago. What a mess! You can do better!
@JetBlue yes, they said the runway isn't ready and they're waiting for port authority to remove the snow and they are no where in sight.
@united when a 2 hour flight turns into a 3:30 ordeal...sigh
@USAirways I am just trying to establish what your policy is. Thanks!
@USAirways I think it's ok.
@SouthwestAir any deals to orlando in April/may??
@USAirways @DRVRugby  team is back home but luggage all wet and partly damaged - Not happy! #blizzard
@United also ran out of water and refused service #costumerservice #legit #jk
@VirginAmerica seats in Row 8 don't recline should mention that on your website #soreback
@AmericanAir 4hrs Late Flightr i get a call back, and immediately disconnected
@USAirways Another dead end.  They only handle AA L&amp;F.  They gave me the same failed # I already had. 610-362-7498(99) VM full.  #lost

@united @AmericanAir THIS IS THE  YEAR FOR VAN GOGH FANS TO VISIT EUROPEhttp://t.co/e1EOfthgAJ
@SouthwestAir I would still have my companion pass if your ridiculous airline hadn't stopped partnering with Hilton Hotels - GENIUS!!!
@JetBlue flight 1025 JFK to TPA 8:05am on Saturday! One way ticket!
@SouthwestAir You guys must have been swamped, even took our corporate travel a long time to get in, but everything worked out in the end.
@JetBlue seriously? System down? No IT?
@JetBlue There's a large family of birds inside T5. Are they fed? Are they there for a purpose?
@AmericanAir should reconsider #usairways acquisition. Flight 1843 AA gold flyers insulted by attendant for hanging jacket!
@AmericanAir they sent her a letter and said they would talk to the stewardess about serving drunks drinks how does that help
@SouthwestAir Thx for your quick response and action! bf will make good use of the voucher #satisfied #happycustomer
@AmericanAir really? Not even worthy of a response. This is beginning of a social media alert to the world that AA and @USAirways are useles
@AmericanAir been on the phone for 47 minutes...said it would be 10...  Any advice?
@SouthwestAir In my letters to follow, I will be sure to include my Rewards Number, twitter handle, and email address.
@united thanks for the re-upgrade to 1st class. It may be a 45 min flight, but it is appreciated.
@AmericanAir My sister just received a call that her trip Wednesday (flts 2348/3499) was Cancelled Flightled and resched to next day. Why?
@USAirways @AmericanAir trying to chg ticket for staff member leaving org before she can fly.We're a nonprofit-can't you make an exception?
@USAirways 7+ hrs stranded in DCA...zero apologies and the worst customer service. Been a faithful traveler for 15+ years, but no more!
@USAirways that wasn‚Äôt my Q but thanks. Wondering why you‚Äôre the only ones. I disguised yours to not call you out. ;) http://t.co/uH6UwuOSC0
@SouthwestAir No thanks. After those 25+ minutes someone did eventually help us and took care of it.
@united I knew I should've flew @VirginAmerica lol
@SouthwestAir its cool that my bags take a bit longer, dont give me baggage blue balls-turn the carousel on, tell me it's coming, then not.
@USAirways good ideas...she is traveling today...at airport.  Need to petition faa regarding silly 24 name change rule.
@USAirways Fortunately you have staff like Lynn S. and DeeDee who actually understand customer service and simply being NICE.
@SouthwestAir We've been sitting at the gate for two hours waiting for bags to be loaded... I'm telling Herb.
@SouthwestAir I don't have a conference number.  I spoke with Courtney in Texas and David before that. they finally fixed mine after an hour
@JetBlue why is flight 1106 delayed out to NY? Same problem?
@united the emails/calls over the past months about flight changes were helpful wish you would have sent them on the Cancelled Flightlation yesterday
@USAirways your rude staff said" I don't care that we are out of market place food you're going on vacation and I have to work" nice huh
@SouthwestAir why do you let one person board with early bird and save seats for entire party? #notcool #flight2149
@JetBlue then this agent demanded I remove my old luggage tag, every other airport the JB agent politely handles it
@AmericanAir Your response could have made all the difference. It could have made the situation better. NO TRUST...GET LOST like my bag.
@united Keep the flights cheap and early/on time and you are good. Flew @AmericanAir  and Cancelled Flightled my flight 4 times last month. United&gt;
@united I am impressed with your super-fast reply to @CGJase
@JetBlue Thank you that it is not just a livery; it is a culture that 16,000+ crewmembers embody daily #thanksDave http://t.co/iNNP0Kkyby
@AmericanAir Why did I have to stand at baggage claim for an hour waiting for a bag that you knew never made it on to the plane?
@VirginAmerica Now, when will we see VirginAmerica come to Philadelphia (PHL).
@SouthwestAir it's ok! Southwest is still the best airline around! Just hate when baggage room runs out.. My now checked bag has headphones!
@USAirways you should get better employees‚úåÔ∏è
@united thank you for 7 hrs at terminal D in Dulles airport http://t.co/IG2dgctt2M
@SouthwestAir apologies are whatever. Please just deliver the bags like you said you would. Feel like employees are lying to me.
@JetBlue 2324 from Orlando to Dca ! And my awesome flight attendant is Robert!
@VirginAmerica do you have an application for iOS? Was looking and only saw Virgin Mexico :( &lt;/3
@AmericanAir I understand. But why is this the only flight of the day not going out? Twice?! I'm now out of extra meds and diapers for baby.
@VirginAmerica trying to book a flight with you guys and your website won't let me... about to lose my business
@AmericanAir what sense is it to charge for a bag service when the service isn't great. Losing luggage and now missing items this is bs
@united I was rebooked but had to take bus from Portland Maine to Boston. Told United does not cover the charge.
@USAirways not going as planned is an understatement. My flight was just changed AGAIN. If it weren't for a family emergency, I'd Cancelled Flight.
@AmericanAir @USAirways cost me a day of vacation ($350 hotel stay), day of dog boarding, and a day of airport parking.
@AmericanAir THANK YOU!!! üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç
@JetBlue would have been good to know months ago that you Cancelled Flightled our flights leaving tomorrow #telleveryone #jetblue #NeverAgain
@USAirways I've tried calling 3 times the past 3 days and I keep getting told to call back. SOMEONE PLEASE HELP ME
@USAirways I keep missing my updated connections. Need to make it to #JAX to be in my friend's wedding! #strandedattheairport
@VirginAmerica on flight VX399 headed to LA from JFK - dirtiest VA plane I have ever been on. Sad for a great airline.
@usairways I just want to get home before Wednesday... Joke is over, 50hrs of Cancelled Flightlations and delays is enough!
@AmericanAir Hi guys, can you tell me what the emergency is for #AA65 diverting to #Heathrow from Zurich-New York? Thanks, John.
@USAirways - been on hold with reservations for over 30 min already! #worstairline
@united thanks! It's 35K miles from RTB to Europe, to do a multiple destination so we could stop over in US on way/way back- mileage diff?
@USAirways @united two broken airplanes, two days Late Flightr and I'm stranded after a funeral and missing out on my last semester of #college. üëç
@AmericanAir Thank you, you too!
@united I am now following you and see that I am not the only one experiencing and noticing a substantial downgrade in service post merger
@AmericanAir The Wichita Falls Airport is the worst, will never fly in or out again.  Unknowledgeable staff.
@united Yo yo yo stuck on the tarmac for over 2 hours at @fly2ohare ... Going to miss my ride at @flypdx help please! #HelpImStuck #United
@USAirways I'm glad too. But I should not have to spend an hour to try and track down the basic information that you already have available.
@AmericanAir finally about to take off! Thanks for the customer service by the g8 reps @ c17 @ CTL. Any idea what caused the system failure?
@SouthwestAir Tough I can take. Zero meaningful assistance while stranded for 2 days is another matter. Looking for signs you care abt cust.
@USAirways 5 hr flight delay and a delay when we land . Is that even real life ? Get me off this plane , I wanna go home üë†üë†üë† (3 heel clicks)
@USAirways Our flight was Cancelled Flightled &amp; chaos abounds. I am in good humour. Please give me free everything to appease me.
@USAirways but wait! They are booked, along with all other hotels nearby. I was sent anyway, to the hotel managers disbelief.
@SouthwestAir  I will dm you now
@USAirways thanks for the worst customer service on the face of the earth. I loved the 5+ hrs on hold along w 2 Cancelled Flightled flights
@USAirways ruined our honeymoon by causing us to miss our international flight, and now we are stranded.
@USAirways hire smarter IT people if your systems keep crashing instead of some of the mooks you man some of these airports with. #goDelta
@AmericanAir aa employees were rude and unwilling to help. 10,000 miles is a rotten cherry on top of a dog shit Sunday. #nocareforcustomers
@AmericanAir thanks for keeping us safe
@AmericanAir Where are your tickets offices in Boston? Impossible to book by phone or use vouchers on website, what a headache. PLEASE HELP!
@JetBlue oh right! Me and hundred people arrived back to the same gate we left minutes ago in SDQ http://t.co/7gB0hgW51t
@SouthwestAir I consider myself a loyal customer to the brand but I'm astounded at the lack of concern about customer's flying experiences.
@united just delayed my flight to SLC by 2.5 hours. What gives? #snowforce
@USAirways US 728 pilot started the flight by announcing arrival into Gatwick, not Heathrow. Moments of concern for all aboard.
@SouthwestAir There is no option just to Cancelled Flight? I don't want to change flight, I want to Cancelled Flight.
@USAirways pilot forgets to show up to work and Ricky J (gate agent) gives customers attitude. #usairwaysfail
@united we were able to get on the moon flight! Just got to our hotel in Puerto Rico! Thank you!
@united can you not get the first flight of the day off the ground on time?   #1531.  Let's go.......
@USAirways - flight was Cancelled Flightled to Buf today. Waited in line for 2+ hrs &amp; cus service was rude. No flight until Tues. Need to get to ROC.
@united I sent the message. Let me know ASAP.
@AmericanAir ‚ÄúInconvenient‚Äù is such a convenient word.
@united has me stranded in Texas and then hangs up on me when I'm trying to figure out how to get home. Cool.
@USAirways US 728 Uh oh, no gate. Now truck will come to us.
@AmericanAir need help on a reservation. Can you follow so that I can DM details? Thanks!
@united EWR agent Barbara was FABULOUS and an example of CUST. SERV. A pleasure talking to youüòä http://t.co/KMQuLY9g5E
@united any chance you could help rebook?? My flight Cancelled Flightled
@JetBlue but the 4 hour policy- when I called and they said I didn't report it soon enough. What would have changed if I had noticed sooner?
@AmericanAir Get a new crystal ball. Cancelled Flight flights before weather hits to rebook me on flight during? Looking like 2 nights hotel on me.
@SouthwestAir would really like my baggage from yesterday. Employees at Akron giving me a tough time.
@united yes... A ride home would be perfect.. A fete one would assume possible after charging 1600$ for a domestic flight... Ps we deplaned
@united YOU GUYS ARE HORRIBLE.
@united can you help from there? UA4935 can't take off without missing galley cart that no one can find. Pax all seated for last hour.
@united please provide update on UA 791. This flight has been stranded by united with no information from the crew on the plane.
@JetBlue thanks for bringing my son home to me.
@united you need to follow me so I can dm you to give you the info
@USAirways waiting for you to figure it out. This is unacceptable.
@united I normally ask people to put on headphones...but not toddlers. Maybe planes should have a "kid" section (near the back) ;)
@JetBlue any info on why flight 704 from SJU to JFK is already delayed 2 1/2 hours?
@USAirways what am I paying you $275 for?   Fly the damn plane!  Not one announcement from the crew.  Let me know how you wanna refund me.
@AmericanAir at LAX &amp; just got off the phone w/reservations. Every flight that'd get me to BOS before 11 am tmrw is apparently unavailable üòê
@SouthwestAir 50min to get bag checked n ATX, miss my flight, spend all day @BWI, n not get my baggage at the end of it all.  #epitimeoffail
.@united It's worth saying that, if you litter in Singapore, you get caned. "But there are rules" says @united
‚Äú@AmericanAir: Bet these birds wish they'd flown south for the #winter... http://t.co/tY9C0Gae2o‚Äù Lol
@americanair One question.. my wife didn't get the bonus. Should I call about it today?
@united you already have vomit so you are halfway there
@united the best seats should be for paying customers and we should get to board first #badcustomerservice
@SouthwestAir Having some trouble checking in. Can you please add me so I can DM you
@SouthwestAir  been on hold  for 2 1/2 hrs. Can't get 2 airport 4 flight icy country backroads! Help pls? @SouthwestAir  #BNA
@AmericanAir i need someone to help me out
@SouthwestAir if I am a rapid awards member, does my points apply after I have taken my round trip?
@AmericanAir long wait? I literally went shopping at 3 different centers, had lunch and prepared dinner. surprise, it's winter! staff better
@AmericanAir why would I pay $200 to reactivate my points that are only useful for certain flights that aren't even worth $200?
@SouthwestAir thank you so so much for sending me to LA for #DestinationDragons! Tonight is gonna rocküòé
@USAirways then why did my whole team be able to put there carry ons under the plane
@USAirways Nick on flight 742 was awesome. Please reward him in some way!!! He has kept us smiling on a bad day of travel. #customerservice
@AmericanAir she sent you an email 2 customer service the night it happened ur response was basically 2 bad sorry how should she contact u.
@USAirways his name is Rett Cavan, he has a gofundme page, and is going to take his last breath tonight. This airline only cares about money
@united Not sure what you are talking about. She is going on nonstop flights. SNA to SFO and then SFO to EWR.
@united @laurasbrown5 What does "dealing via email" have anything to do with a crappy web form that is not made for mobile devices
@JetBlue @amybruni @DIRECTTV No Oscars on Direct TV on this flight. We were so looking forward to it. We were devastated. :-/
@JetBlue get flight 16 into the air
@SouthwestAir weather bc of system outage. Hopefully everything goes smoothly now. Thank you for follow up
@AmericanAir still on hold. After you hung up on me the first time (another 45 minutes!) http://t.co/IMRLAu77iH
@united customer service is atrocious! You have disrupted my travel plans, you have lost my luggage and it is impossible to TALK TO A HUMAN
@united its in black and white. EU law and all that ‚Ç¨600 for a Cancelled Flightled flight. I want my money
@USAirways Merging AA and DividendMiles yield an error. What are the _exact_ steps to navigate the phone menu? All I get is a computer.
@united i will never be flying with #UnitedAirlines ever again. $285 for checked bags? All under 50lbs? #angrycustomer #unitedairlinessuck
@SouthwestAir thanks for your attention, I've been flying southwest for 3 years and haven't had this issue in the past.
@SouthwestAir App Updated With #Passbook Support http://t.co/WrWqrUblPs via @ubergizmo
@AmericanAir ....I am on attempt #6 and hour #10 of calling and being put on hold.  Not feeling confident that I will ever get through...
@united @CheerTymeDad Gee that's like almost caring about ppl more than $$.  Think I'm more int in having a trusted adult w/ daughter .
@SouthwestAir when can I start Flight Booking Problems for next years super bowl time? üò©#help
@united Thank you. Any help is appreciated.
@JetBlue quick ? Why is a person traveling w  a mosaic not get the green tag? Doesn't make sense I end up waitin 4 my sons bag anyway :/
@JetBlue I thought being a mosaic member had 'perks' the best part is instead of checking the extra 5lbs I'm carrying it on üòí
@AmericanAir @maryella_green despite the inconvenience, the situation was handled quickly and we appreciate it very much!
@AmericanAir I don't know who that may be. I was also working from home. Thanks for nothing.
@JetBlue rather than trying to resolve customer issues, only options offered were paying cash @ airport or write letter. #JustifyThisSupport
@JetBlue anything for you. #flyfi http://t.co/8jceDiKY9U
Now put your baggage fees back on "free." RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/oxsA8btVTB
@united time for a rant...you delayed my flight and still forgot my luggage...then delayed on the Tarmac, moments I love you United
@VirginAmerica I am all about the in flight artisanal cheese and wine pairing.
@united I have 8 flights with you in the next two weeks :) let's make some good memories!
@united is so cheap they couldn't afford to run the AC on #UA1510. They took pressure cooker to a new level. #Cheap #WorstAirline
@united Never can get a flight out on time. 4 hour delay earlier another hour delay on my connecting flight. Makes 10 straight delays
@VirginAmerica #wtf I paid for direct flight on purpose not to have to stop for fuel exhausted frequent flier and nothing for inconvenience!
@united What is the policy behind changing passengers' seating assignments at the gate?
@united the least you could do is offer me a ticket in coach instead of just Cancelled Flighting my reservation because of your glitch!!! #notfair
@USAirways I have two tight connections in #Charlotte and #Frankfurt
@AmericanAir flight 3056 in D/FW now delayed 2 hours waiting sitting in plane for baggage to be loaded - why?
@AmericanAir the reservation system won't even let us leave our phone #. I have no way to fix that you rebooked me on wrong day!
@united Wasn't frustrating! Well, not in any way reLate Flightd to y'all, anyway. Impressed that I made it.
@USAirways providing poor customer service by responding to complaints with a copy and paste tempLate Flight unreLate Flightd to complaint #usairwaysfail
@SouthwestAir been all up and down the area where the pic was taken and don't see any albums.
@SouthwestAir gimme
@USAirways flight today Cancelled Flighted  in phl, dozens of other flights still going. On hold for 3hrs. I need to get to my job interview!!!
@JetBlue a 5 year old can't sit alone on a flight. This is absurd. And this guy is a dick. #jetblue http://t.co/2HXsDP0ha4
@united I flew back w other company since United didnt have an earlier flight
‚Äú@JetBlue: @benjaminokeefe Thanks for including us on your tour! Did you pack your winter coat?‚ÄùUnfortunately yes ‚ùÑÔ∏è‚õÑÔ∏è #WereNotinCaliAnymore
@AmericanAir Extend rtn flight to bereavement, 22nd I could have change fee dropped, now told no.Worse day of my life #badcustomerservice
@SouthwestAir disappointed in the 'service' I've received. Checked in online, checked my my flight status online, CHECKED IN AT THE AIRPORT
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/mFSsh2UHUe‚Äù LMFAO!!!!!!!!!!
@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united
@JetBlue flite454
@SouthwestAir thank you :)
@VirginAmerica can we make every VX plane with #nerdbird? Why should Austin be the only one getting nerd love?
@SouthwestAir answered. My options are a refund or a resched for Monday (I'd miss work). So I'm paying hundreds for a @USAirways flight tmw.
@USAirways just realized my @AmericanAir advantage number wasn't used for my flight.  How do I get my ff miles?
Still thinking, those PJs may have me sold @AmericanAir @momsgoodeats We'd #love to have you on board with us! @MandarinJourney here I come
@SouthwestAir please do. Hate having to fly a different airline. You're my fav.
@AmericanAir I guess I was one of the select few that hadn't had many problems before this and all the sudden my whole trip got jacked
@SouthwestAir now our pilots timed out...#getmeoutofhere
@AmericanAir I have a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning and the 800 number did nothing! Please! I just want to go home!
@SouthwestAir you do a great job of achieving that at most cities, just not at BWI.
@USAirways thanks!
@USAirways  - I had 20,748 miles in  my account and was informed I'd forfeit them bc of 33 months of inactivity - I
@SouthwestAir My husband is responding to him and he insist to remove him from the seat. BTW signs are in both English and Spanish.
@USAirways Still waiting for another crew member. #cabinfever
@USAirways and no offers to provide us with a hotel or anything for a flight that is over 19 hours away!
@SouthwestAir never mind, I moved my flight to tomorrow. Thanks for the help!
@USAirways I keep getting hung up on. PLEASE respond so I can book a ticket with you. I won't be able to buy one unless I speak to someone!
@VirginAmerica Beats EPS Views, Takes On #SouthwestAir VA LUV - Investor's Business Daily http://t.co/FLwmGDAHxu

@SouthwestAir and thx for not responding
@AmericanAir 1491 DEN -&gt; DFW. We don't want to be ticketed on a new flight, just refunded for our Cancelled Flighted flight.
@united my baggage is in shannon now so never mind u can work on giving me some $$$ back now
@USAirways @AmericanAir can someone help me with some travel issues today?
@united trying to get a customer service agent.  Just landed in SFO.  Can't fly with 3 layovers with 3 kids!!
@USAirways Not one to complain much but really 1 hour 15minutes and still nothing. Agents or Agent ‚§µ http://t.co/Q5SB0DaVuy
@AmericanAir The delay is nothing but the personnel being so combative up to the point of saying "what's the hury,  the plane is not leaving
@VirginAmerica thanks for that. Been needing a way to make those Austin trips from DCA, and now you've come through!
@AmericanAir There are only 24 hours to Cancelled Flight or change itineraries booked online and that 24 hours is just about over. Impossible scenario
@united it's like you're trying to make me hate your airline. Fee for each checked bag that's never mentioned in the ticket + rude agents üëø
@USAirways @AmericanAir hey guys, due to some horrible customer service issues is there any way I can get a checked bag credit?
@USAirways 3rd connecting flight delayed but still cannot make it &amp; still unable to speak to a real person
@USAirways my friends are stuck at KPHL and not getting any help from anyone, can you guys contact them please?
@USAirways terrible service
@JetBlue the whole plane. Flight 561 from LGA to PBI http://t.co/4Ktk2hsmGy
@USAirways missing our connection due to delay out of @LAS. Told not looking good for tmrw either. We will be stuck in #CLT. Help!
@USAirways This was a real life exercise in crisis management which @USAirways failed miserably. Some compensation would go a long way.
@united 1632 was phenomenal frm gate (SEA) to gate (IAD)
@SouthwestAir Thanks for the text, but not exactly timely 8). Data throughout issues today maybe? http://t.co/aaU9MKA6Zy
@SouthwestAir thanks for the Cancelled Flightation today. Only airline that's Cancelled Flighted. Lost a customer today.
@USAirways @AmericanAir 2hrs Late Flightr finally taking offüòÇüòÇüòÇ
@AmericanAir is there not an email address I can send my issue to? you guys screwed up and rebooked my flight to the wrong day!  please help
@USAirways great job communicating to the passengers! Flight 1855 doesn't exist anymore? http://t.co/hLZaHXkdSn
@AmericanAir Oh trust me. I am in love. It is so beautiful!
@USAirways flight #3900 fro ORF to PHL.
@JetBlue thanks but still annoying. Especially if I miss my flight. üòâ Can I tweet at the TSA??
@AmericanAir Same as yesterday's Cancelled Flighted flight. AA104. Your customer support is just awful!
@SouthwestAir oh, is it only in Atlanta?
@USAirways understood and so does us airways.  Getting through tsa is the problem
@united thank you for following up!
@VirginAmerica I see what you did there ;)
@USAirways FUK U US AIRWAYS WITH YO SHITTY CHICKEN SALAD SANDWICH THAT SO OVERPRICED AND U FUKING MAKE ME WAIT IN A 6 HR LAYOVER FUK U AND
@AmericanAir I can't keep dialing you guys all day. Can I get into the callback queue?
@SouthwestAir Traveling with a 13 year old Thursday. He does not need an ID, correct?
@united the delay is due to customer service for 20 people?  What about the DIS-SERVICE you provided for 100+?  #FlightFail #Hour20Delay
@united i got email that my reservations got Cancelled Flightled and i will be refunded.  Nothing got refunded as of yet
@JetBlue we were supposed to be Vieques by 3pm
@USAirways site shows on-time but FlightAware site shows delayed. Trying to decide if I get out in this ice to catch FLT 456 to PHX.
@JetBlue you are missing the point. The flight left an hour Late Flight. Why are you allowed to be that Late Flight, and still charge me $50 and 10hrs?
@SouthwestAir Any idea why TSA Pre-Check isn't showing for my next flight tomorrow? The number is in my profile...
@AmericanAir actually, online indicates the only seating available is at a premium cost..why not allow seat selection at time of purchase
@SouthwestAir Loved one's flight ATL to IND Cancelled Flightled due to "ice in Indy". Sitting here in Indy, it is bone dry. Tomorrow 4-6" of snow.
@SouthwestAir just had a great flight #4223 with Damion! He was the best #damionflight4223
@JetBlue thank you for being jetblue and not jetgreen or jetred. blue is my favorite color! and jet blue makes it better :)
@AmericanAir why am I continually getting put on hold by painfully inexperienced people when calling your Platinum desk?!
@USAirways I paid for my ticket on @PayPal on the 13th and it still says pending. Is that normal? I just want the money out of my account.
@AmericanAir your staff at rsw working the sliver airlines desk is not helpful. We can not get any information about our flight.
@united It is all good -- your 1K team has been nothing short of amazing with everything.
@JetBlue we've been delayed and delayed here in Palm beach... Need to head to Westchester. Can you give me some info?
@AmericanAir why thank you!! Yayayay!!
@AmericanAir just want to thank you guys for the 27 hour delay for flight AA106 from JFK due to staff shortage and not weather‚úàÔ∏è
@united has the WORST customer svcs! This Kevin rep at call center must be investigated. My baggage's lost and there's no help but argument!
@USAirways over the phone. I called the 6170 number and she picked up almost immediately.
‚Äú@SouthwestAir: @AMiltx3 You are forgiven most loved Customer,,,it's as if you never left :) ^LL‚Äù that's why you're bae ‚ù§Ô∏è
@AmericanAir How do I check? Reservation for Joe Watson and Kelsey Jennings. We were on hold for 2 hours. Waiting for call back now. ETA?
@SouthwestAir luckily, the people working the BSO at Chicago Midway have been very attentive and found our bags in Punta Cana.
@SouthwestAir 8FKQW is the conf #. Thanks for the reply
@united screwed over my professor. Maybe we should tell everyone about @Skiplagged ? #aviation #airport #airline #innovation #startups #tech
@SouthwestAir while you clearly didn't care about our troubles yday thought I'd share bags took &gt;90min and came back absolutely drenched..
@AmericanAir stranded in Miami because your automated system keeps hanging up on me for two days. Help !
@JetBlue It's for me, I spoke with a rep on the phone who suggested I "Voice a concern" via "Email us" on your site. I did a few moments ago
@SouthwestAir hi guys, do you have a general enquires email address please? Thanks David.
@AmericanAir yes they do http://t.co/wCSAZZQPae
@SouthwestAir Dear SWA, I fly you a lot.   Most of the time, amazing. Today: unacceptable.I am sitting here in Midway delayed 20 min....
@united I want a hotel room and a whiskey.
@SouthwestAir @TMadCLE Flying with you in April, first time on southwest. Can't wait!!! Flew American airlines last time. Was meh.
@USAirways This is dating back to Nov. I have been sent back and forth between you and @eDreams_en. It's a disgrace.
@AmericanAir already did &amp; an automated voice told us to wait 2 hours. They have yet to call back.
@USAirways  #USAirways disappoints AGAIN! #Cancelled Flighted flights #Missed appointments #Promised refund is a lie
@united's first flight (4651, to #IAH) from #IAD is delayed...because no one hooked up ground power to the plane. Get it together, folks.
@USAirways F623 DEN:PHX impressive lack of concern by 1hr+ Late Flight flight attndt wrecking havoc on customer travel #smugsmirk #norush

@USAirways despite mechanical issues and many delays followed by a Cancelled Flightlation, still getting to Vegas thanks to great gate agents!
@USAirways even alternate options are allready full...even with hotel voucher...no more room in philly?
@united @AmericanAir so that's it? It just ends there? Come on! I traveled for literally an extra day and a half because of this!
@JetBlue thanks so much. Can't wait to fly with you guys :)
@AmericanAir @EdPlotts don't bother trying to get anywhere with their customer service team either as take 2+ months and counting to reply

@VirginAmerica thanks for taking care of @SuuperG on her flight!! #rockstars #travel
@united you realize you've said this already. At least last time you asked if I needed "help"
@united Thanks for the timely service &amp; great staff getting my wife and me to and from Cancun this past week for our honeymoon.
@USAirways Now I am probably going to miss my connection in Charlotte, so I will have to drive home for the funeral.
@USAirways rebooked for Tuesday. Arriving too Late Flight for on Tuesday to start the class. Cancelled Flightled the trip.
@USAirways, 1st a reaccommodation, now a delayed flight for this one.  &amp; the Gate Agent still hasn't mumbled a word. Folks getting anxious.
@AmericanAir These are some awesome photos. Thanks for sharing! üòÅ
@USAirways flights to Dfw Cancelled Flightled today?
@AmericanAir 24 hours on the AirPort
@united I have to go back home! I have to use what the company has available. But it's unfair to stay more than 24 h traveling
@AmericanAir please allow me to speak with someone. A dialogue would solve this issue better and faster than emailing.
@AmericanAir "Airport snow removal method #22..."Keep up the good work folks, this is where Cessna's become 747's! http://t.co/oUmC1LrXDN
@JetBlue got it wish they would communicate more w us
@SouthwestAir they put me on the next flight available.. tomorrow morning :( Any idea if BNA will be open in the morning for my flight?
@USAirways @AmericanAir 2 trips in a row with missing luggage. Just like last time. I pay for baggage to be transported.
@united Follow me back, please, and I'll happily DM you the link because I'd rather not share my travel plans publicly.
@united Give Cyndi &amp; Troy each a gold star.
@SouthwestAir I'm not sure I did the messaging part right. Please let me know if you received it.

@AmericanAir I have to miss a whole days worth of work tomorrow but I'm suree you guys don't care
@united @UCtraveladvisor - I would have loved to respond to your website until I saw the really long form. In business the new seats are bad
@SouthwestAir thanks for taking such good care of my luggage... http://t.co/PIvxean3jY
@JetBlue This is absurd. Should a stranger help my kids if there's a problem? #jetblue http://t.co/LAiGgef9Kj
@USAirways flight 1946 out of clt this morning.  It's snowing here.  Should i head out to the airport?
@USAirways great operation you guys are running. More mechanical issues, and now taping piece of plane together LOL http://t.co/I5V9wfbtuE
@JetBlue #flyfi thank you! Seattle and #UDUB here we come! @cameron__roe http://t.co/kbHYM5GkAP
@USAirways I sympathize re:weather issues, but when times get tough, call in more folks. Over two hours on hold for 4-minute fix. #FAIL
@united Flight is awful only one lavatory functioning, and people lining up, bumping, etc. because can't use 1st class bathroom. Ridiculous
@USAirways @AmericanAir According to your costumer support your website is holding my money hostage and you cant do anything about it..
@USAirways @AmericanAir for frequent flyer miles can we schedule interchangeably and get credit?
@SouthwestAir my son is flying South West from NOLA-Orlando, hope to enter for him to win this contest #DestinationDragons
@united Y do U not reply to customer refund forms??????????? #unitedairlines
@united I took the exact same aircraft in to LAX 3 days ago. It fit, no problem. The agent today told some nonsense about a policy change
@SouthwestAir your employees were great!
@JetBlue  hahah üòÇüëåüëåüëå love flying jet blue tho!! http://t.co/7VeE44MACM
@USAirways Good morning.
@united How does that make a flight takeoff on time? And regardless it makes me Late Flight because now I have to wait for my bag at baggage claim.
@SouthwestAir u were bae until u lost both of my bags and had no clue where they were or what happened to them for 36 hours :/
@JetBlue that sucks. Oh well.
@JetBlue where did my travel bank credit go?  I can't call you right now.
@AmericanAir @marxsterbcow How is this a real life response to a customer service issue? Seriously. Keep trying to call us. Eh, might work.
Lmfaooo ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/1G9RnmYUQe‚Äù
@JetBlue @KyleJudah I just spoke to the baggage claim center and they gave me travel credit but will not be responsible for the cost of a
@USAirways Customer service is dead. Last wk, flts delayed/Cancelled Flighted. Bags lost 4 days. Last nt, flt delayed/Cancelled Flighted.  No meal voucher?
@united this is why I fly @SouthwestAir ... Never have any issues
@united How come you are the ONLY airline, of 90+ flights last year that makes me check my carry-on. Not even gate check...baggage claim?!?
@united no chance in hell. I'd rather walk. Worst airline ever.
@usairways. Seriously, attendants go AWOL for 60 mins.   Now flight further delayed.   Don't lite a match either http://t.co/mT8sPlm02v
@SouthwestAir crazy hold times today. Over an hour now. Help?
@SouthwestAir my sister and her family had to drive 1200 miles because you did not accommodate a rebook in a timely manner! HORRIBLE
@AmericanAir try this. DPDFPP
@united keeps delaying my flight, horrible customer service
@JetBlue all they said was delayed due to mechanical issues. I'm looking for something a little more specific.
@SouthwestAir not sure I can trust a statement with that many small numbers above words. http://t.co/o3sRL1hfho
@AmericanAir my understanding is they were able and did for many other flights but chose not to for this one.
@AmericanAir Thanks. Took care of it. Issue was IVR was unclear and took too long to get a call-back option. Would love to see that fixed.
@united What a really GREAT &amp; FLATTERING story about you! You should be very proud :) http://t.co/7br5t5QCXk (via @ParachuteGuy)
@JetBlue maybe have a supervisor find out why the international checkin at FTL hasn't moved in 20 minutes yet employees picked up 100 pizza
@AmericanAir and just bad cs! I will be back on @JetBlue  at least when you stuck they look out for you and apologize for any trouble
@united I have never been mislead by a company as many times as I have this week by United Airlines!
@JetBlue friendly, engaging, personable, handled clarifying questions about baggage fees well, and took an interest in what I was doing.
@JetBlue can't link my flight from last week to my TruBlue account and 1800 num isn't answering..don't make me fly @Delta again, dont do it!
@SouthwestAir when I called I was told my bag had made it to PHL, but still has not been delivered or any call from the delivery service
@SouthwestAir I'm so upset that my luggage was damaged and the rude employee at the Laguardia airport didn't help!
@united what's the point of offering a free checked bag of you lose it?
@USAirways NEVER AGAIN! Worse experience in my life. http://t.co/3dDQq0gQni
@AmericanAir of delays and trapped on planes with no water or air. Never ever ever again. #neveragain #aafail
@united it would make my day if I could take a flight on your airline without any hiccups on your end. Train your employees to communicate
@USAirways 1826 trying to make a connection to Punta Cana leave PHL at 9:50
@usairways and @AmericanAir  4 days of Cancelled Flightations, I have driven to 3 airports in 3 different states, spent more on gas than my flight.
@JetBlue you guys rock!! http://t.co/LA397zaoAY
@AmericanAir you guys need to educate your employees on what a pink tag is AND STOP LOSING MY GUITAR FOR THE 10 THOUSANDTH TIME!
@AmericanAir thanks for the DM rescheduling. Unfortunately your operations process at LAX is chaos &amp; the reps refused to print the ticket
@SouthwestAir did you pick the winners for the #DestinationDragons ?? #87yearsLate Flightr #maybeijustlost #whyyounoloveme
@united that's great! pls let me know when u start!
@USAirways I will. Is it down or is just me?
@United fucked up, then voided my ticket, and KEPT MY MONEY.  Not even an apology. I will never fly with your airline again. #UnitedAirlines
@USAirways HA!  You're fun.
@JetBlue Well being on time is not going to happen now. Safety does come 1at. Looks like I'll have 2 look 4 another flight now #1stTimeFlyer
@AmericanAir sure, thank you!
@AmericanAir  so far all I am getting is "maybe your bag will come today. We don't know." Website says "status unknown"- can you help?
@united this is in ur Hemispheres magazine. I'm open to what will u do to make the "flight more pleasant." http://t.co/VrQDpqEPFW
@USAirways where's our luggage? Been waiting more than an hour! Flight 2118.
@SouthwestAir Left my computer on the plane. Two weeks Late Flightr they found it and sent it to me. #greatservice.  #happy #customer
@JetBlue appreciate the response but already spoke to a MCO and their response was "There is nothing we can do" idk if that's what you mean
@JetBlue my daughter's college game in Denver.  Only one set of parents will be there üò¢üò¢üò¢
@JetBlue is blaming @TSA for flight 584 luggage debacle!  #luggagegate
@united you do realize my wife is waiting on a delayed flight at this very moment.  I'm not sure I understand your tweet.
@SouthwestAir stop Cancelled Flighting my flight I have US history tests to take and chemistry things to learn do you not understand!!!!!!!!!
@united There are Exit-Row window shades in approx 11% of the windows  of your RJ-145s. &lt;--a frequent flyer http://t.co/aOEaeszDLX
@united That's real dedication &amp; concern. Your apologies don't fix the issue nor any of the miserable issues I've had over the past 6 mos.
@USAirways so I would have to go though the entire process again just to get you people on the phone???????? #usairwayssucks
@USAirways now has stranded is in #Miami without updating any of the departure boards, and once they Cancelled Flightled the flight there was no...
@united thanks
@USAirways thank you for the apology
@USAirways really? 8 hr delay in Virgin Island and not even a food voucher.
@JetBlue not to get into semantics here but "by" means "within the extent or period of; during" and it is still technically 2/19 #dictionary
@AmericanAir I‚Äôll play it by ear. I know that you are doing your best. Buy some chewey oatmeal cookies for your customer care folks.
@united Also, a United phone representative just asked me for my web password. Is that normal?
@JetBlue's new CEO seeks the right balance to please passengers and Wall ... - Greenfield Daily Reporter http://t.co/LM3opxkxch
@united your customer service is terrible! Stood inline 3 hours no flights and 4 hours Late Flightr still no bag#disgutedindenver
@AmericanAir - keeping AA up in the Air! My crew chief cousin Alex Espinosa in DFW! http://t.co/0HXLNvZknP
@USAirways when do we get our baggages? @usaireays 699 LA to RDU http://t.co/vU5lBZXtRX
@SouthwestAir my bag was Late Flight-checked and put on a different flight from OAK-&gt;MSY. Having troubles tracking it down. Any help?
@AmericanAir I tried that &amp; they have been disrespectful not professional &amp; my 2nd flight been Cancelled Flighted I have to get home for a surgeryHELP
@USAirways is not the new @AmericanAir is more like the new @SpiritAirlines. Love AA. Not impressed with the subpar planes and gate agents.
@USAirways how about a little help for the two gate agents trying to rebook flight 1707?
@SouthwestAir shout out to the flight #4386 crew for taking amazing care of us on our double down flight! #thankyou
@SouthwestAir Thank you for the tip!
@SouthwestAir can you please DM me who I can speak with regarding my receipts and who I can email a presidential level complaint
@USAirways worst experience with you. Cancelled Flightled flight, no voucher and no luggage because "ramp was broken." No other ramps in Charlotte??
@SouthwestAir @PHLAirport Will Flight 2155 that arrives at E11 be a penguin plane?
@USAirways @AmericanAir - Can flight #415 get the paperwork inputted?? We should have taken off an hour .. #sittingontheplane #hungry
@AmericanAir Thanks. Having issues checking in for flight, please check our DM convo for more info.
@united kind of unnerving to watch the guy deicing your plane text on his phone the whole time http://t.co/QdXfT9qqT9
@AmericanAir I tried, EXTREMELY RUDE. Even the supervisor. And when I asked to speak to HIS supervisor I was told no
@SouthwestAir thank you for Cancelled Flighting my flight, last minute of course, to #GIS2015. I'm now missing one full day of my trip thanks to this!
@AmericanAir I saw it finally come through on the mobile app. However it's for tomorrow and I have meetings tonight that I'm trying to make.
@SouthwestAir hates guitar players. Chgd for oversize AND extra bag on my acoustic guitar. Epic fail.
@JetBlue they say they have no update. I don't work I don't get paid.  Jet blue has my money but no flight. Argh!
@united Today was not your finest. All could have been prevented by one gate agent advising 200 passengers.
@United and here i thought American was bad. Horrible Service. Over 2:30 min Late Flight. No excuse!
@JetBlue Hello! Can you tell me if you currently fly to Hawaii? Thanks!
@JetBlue @JayVig @roxydigital awww ^_^ R to the T, realtime appreciation from JetBlue #rockingthetweets #JVMChat
@AmericanAir Orbitz has only shown "priority" seats since we booked &amp; paid 3 weeks ago.
@AmericanAir the app doesn't allow Canadian address. I used the mobile Canadian site and it will not let you select a passenger.
@SouthwestAir this was the 3rd Cancelled Flightlation in 2 days due to weather in Nashville. 3 trips to the airport. Each time communicated Late Flight by SW
@united I have been denied. Not sure how you charge $150 one way then $25 on way hime
@USAirways thanks but the bags are only 10% of what went wrong. 22 hours from DCA to SAN when there were no weather issues is not acceptable
@AmericanAir one staff on desk. Now been queuing for over an hr.
@united I'm familiar with the procedure. It wouldn't be the first time #UnitedAirlines lost one of my bags. #unhappytraveler
@united line is just getting longer and moving slower. Lady working the counter is doing great, she just needs help. #customerservicefail
@USAirways haven't eaten all day either so lemme get that CC# so I can buy a burger across from the terminal.  #DoBetter @UsAirwaysSuck
@united 8 hours Late Flightr and I'm siting on another plane waiting to leave. I think a credit is in order for this terrible service!
@USAirways Saddens me that my first tweet - ever - has to be a complaint about customer service.
@AmericanAir I need to complain to AA, but the email form field doesn't allow enough characters for my complaint. Have a real email address?
@USAirways  can you help me out?
@united I went from Sacramento to Minneapolis at the end of October 2014 in business class.
@united I did start a claim but 8-10 weeks is unrealistic, am I really supposed to go that long with out a car seat for my child.Ridiculous!
@united you left my bag in Houston last night. It's freezing cold in Memphis. Any idea on when I will see it? Off again tomorrow.
@AmericanAir but have been yet to receive assistance from one of your agents in securing a new connection. Many will now miss work tomorrow.
@USAirways its fine. Just wondering where my money went...
@SouthwestAir could you please tell me if there is a way to add a RR# to a flight that already took place?
@USAirways Cancelled Flights flight Tampa to Philadelphia today due to runway conditions yet tonnes of USAirways flights landing there today, explain!
@united some compensation (e.g. upgrade to higher class for my rescheduled flight to MUC today) will be appreciated, though ;)
@AmericanAir , sitting on plane for 2.5hrs at gate due to computer sys issue, at what point do you Cancelled Flight a flight?, ridiculous @PHLAirport
@united Missing crew, passenger doc problems, frozen toilets, and now we're off the plane. Give me my money back.  UA3466
@JetBlue The chairs could use some TLC. And more power outlets in the area would be a bonus. Headed to @UniversalORL !
@SouthwestAir using social business roadmap to develop intelligent path to embed social across enterprise #RaganDisney
@united. If you show available seats, you need to honor that! I shouldnt spend 1hr on phone to hear that "really there are 3 not 4 seats"
@AmericanAir American Airlines.
@united pedophile airline. Split myself and my 10 yr old daughter rows apart on flight 1254 to boston
@AmericanAir should reconsider #usairways acquisition. Flight 1843 AA gold flyers insulted by attendant for hanging jacket!
@JetBlue Highlight of my travel is 3 hour delay and de-icing twice. Now sitting in bumper to bumper traffic in taxi to finally get home. üòí
@united thanks.  Not tonight it would seem. http://t.co/WNdcEO5QlK
@united yes! I'll be sending an email to customer service today.
@united Why announce it is for rollers at all? If I want to put a coat in there isn't that my choice?  How about all gate checked? Thx
@JetBlue OOH! Good one! Speaking of #MiAmore - Just know that #IAdore https://t.co/fWZClBvuG4 Loving #LoveSongFriday
@americanair Yes to the iOS. I'm running iOS 8.1.3
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flight previous request. Will accept ticket number for document number
@AmericanAir Can't get thru by phone to use a credit that's about to expire! #frustrated #aa.com
@USAirways I have a voucher from a past trip that was delayed. I thought I had to talk to someone on the phone to use it. Is that not true?
@USAirways why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the gate
@united met with agent. All taken care of. Thx for reply
@USAirways if a passenger is to large to put down the armrest and now is using part of my seat, what is my recourse?  #nothappy
@USAirways 799 from AMS to PHL today- 3 of 4 flight attendants were downright rude and hostile and made the 8+ hour flight even worse.
@USAirways they weren't able to without reFlight Booking Problems and recharging the amount plus $25 fee for help over phone. Spoke to 2 agents &amp; Jeanine
@USAirways Being put back on hold for what has now been an HOUR is completely unacceptable.
@USAirways Kudos to Robin at @PHXSkyHarbor Lost/Found for reuniting me w/ my iPad. She was delightful to work with!
@USAirways Your app and website are trash AF.
@AmericanAir I'm trying my hardest to not get frustrated, but I am getting no response on email or by phone. AA owes me $500. How do I claim
@USAirways I waited on hold for too long. I shouldn't have to wait on hold forever when I never received a confirm. in the 1st place #help
@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: no one around to close said door. More strange. Now we're not hearing from pilot for long periods.
@AmericanAir --(pt 2) and the AA reservations phone number has been less than helpful, telling me to change things online when I can't.
@AmericanAir Is large Wichita Falls Airport not receiving any arrivals? I have called and no one answers. I been waiting for 1 day
@JetBlue sounds fun! How does that work?
@UsAirways  your person taking tickets is rude and now we are delayed 4-50 minutes because you overfilled fuel on the plane #500.
@JetBlue Although it wasn't totally the answer I was looking for, I appreciate the prompt response.
@united I work in customer support- extremely saddened United won't waive change fee for flights I had to Cancelled Flight due to east coast storms.

@JetBlue why is my 910 flight listed on time when its 904AM and I'm not on the plane yet? http://t.co/iEG2ObcEpp
@JetBlue That's great! Thank you.
@USAirways a big thanks to the gate agent flt5127..keeping us informed of the delay#greatcustomerservice
@united yes, computer would allow me to get to San Diego quick but customer service will not help.  Says can't rebook http://t.co/KcVUbUYExc
@united I JUST ASKED MY BOYFRIEND TO PROM OVER THE LOUDSPEAKER ON FLIGHT 494 HE SAID YES!!!! BEST DAY EVER!!! THANK U SO MUCH!!!!!!
@AmericanAir #epicfail on connections in #Chicago today, extremely disappointed w/ unaccommodating customer service, rethinking loyalty üòê
@AmericanAir Still sitting in airport as 6:05 flt delayed until 6:55...but still not boarding, what is happening?  No info....
@united FAIL You Cancelled Flightled our flight frm GJT and then used our reserv home to IAH (from SEA) for reFlight Booking Problems w/out OUR PERMISSION!! #PH6RPS
@USAirways how are you even still in business? i have been trying to call for hours. this is pathetic.
@AmericanAir if my flight gets Cancelled Flightled i should be able to reschedule to any date i want, not the next day or 2 days after
@united flight Cancelled Flightled to Denver service agent offered me a non jet salt lake to Denver or red eye out of Atlanta then hung up on me.

@SouthwestAir when will you be accepting reservations past August 7?
@americanair Greatest Newark Gate Agents ever: David Deane, Norma Sedholm and Luz Calderon just made me feel like a king. #AmericanAirlines
@AmericanAir because your plane's toilet wasn't working and they needed gas. This is flight 1081 leaving Dulles going to LAX. Do some...
@VirginAmerica wish you flew out of Atlanta... Soon?
@USAirways the gate agent said "it's booked in full. Sorry" I had a ticket with a 1st class seat. I will call customer service when I land.
@united did you have seen my message today?? About a mcdonnell Douglas dc 10 model?? I will hear it if you read it, Goodnight now
@AmericanAir pity that a machine replied, or perhaps my story not unusual. Expected better response given article in in-flight magazine.
@SouthwestAir you will extend if I call the day it expires.why can't it just be extended now?#mightmismybrosgraduation
@AmericanAir your a LIAR, no precipitation all day, 47 degrees, don't pacify, you look like a fool.......thats the problem, admit you suck
@jetblue Havana, Cuba - To share my love of photography and leave pictures behind, as well as to deliver much-needed items. #flyingitforward
@SouthwestAir No no no. SWA low fares and on-time service is great! But manufactured quirkiness? Mmm, not so much. Signed, -CaptiveAudience
@united Just sent! Thanks :)
@VirginAmerica ...Please come to Minneapolis St. Paul!
@JetBlue something they're not telling us (2)
@USAirways 100 feet from the gate at PHL, but no ground crew. You can't make this up.
@united messaged you as requested- and called your baggage team again. It's STILL in Newark. please help or let me know next steps!!
@united it will be on a different airline.
@united I miss the Continental days.
@USAirways And you took away my 1st class seat.  Love being a Chairman Preferred and assigned row 24 seat B middle seat
@AmericanAir Hopefully you ll see bad ones as opportunity to get better and not dwell in it... and the good ones as encouragement words!
@united How long can I expect the formal response to take?
@united why don't you de-ice while the plane sits there with no one in it for 2 hours ?? Or we could just delay :/
@United THANK U! Secured room for the night Thx to VERY helpful customer service rep N. Dorns.. I thanked her.. Can u 2? #goodenoughmother
@united thanks for all the help! Totally appreciate it and you made it super easy too
@USAirways You guys are screwing up my trip. Thanks for nothing. #lazy
@AmericanAir big surprise flight 2330 is delayed. Hopefully not for 6 hours like our flight here.  Thanks again for a sleepless night.
@JetBlue Domestic.  To be clear -- I do not have to sit in (your lovely) terminal, just need to be there 1 hour prior to boarding?  Thanks!
@united yes I do.
@AmericanAir a school trip of 38 including myself had to sleep over in the airport and are all on different standby flights.This is not good
@SouthwestAir will continue to be my airline of choice. @united -most frustrating travel day I've experienced. 5 delays and 4 gate changes?!
@united Hi if a premium ec upgrade was paid for &amp; then a mileage BF upgrade done is the prem Eco upgrade fare refunded?
@AmericanAir  you have now lost my luggage for40 hours holding for4 hrs on phone #wtf is this how you treat your loyal passengers?#stranded
@SouthwestAir you should know the crew today on flight #1071 AUS to PDX was awesome! #SWA
@USAirways anyone there to help? Still on hold...
@SouthwestAir @Imaginedragons when are we gonna know I have a math test tomoro and I can't concentrateüò≠üò≠ #DestinationDragons
@AmericanAir you need to work harder on the disconnect between your intention and the reality your passengers face
@united I'm flying @AmericanAir on the way back. I rarely fly them but let's see if they are any better....
@united Leaving soon. Thanks!
@united finally made it to rep, who solved my problem.
@SouthwestAir MAC computer left on BWI to LA flight on 14th.  Reward for recovery; info important to owner.#HELP #passengers #honesty
@AmericanAir you're almost as bad as @united
@SouthwestAir 2 1/2 hours Late Flight, but I made it to sf! Maybe you can help me get on an earlier flight on Sunday :)
@USAirways was transf, held 15-18 min more b4 agent answered and helped. By time I got to person fare I'd seen was gone.  Had to get supv.
@AmericanAir arrived in lax from ord flight AA1657 NO LUGGAGE
@United Over the last week, United has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life. Disgusting. #united
@united 1.75 hour delay.  Nothing says sorry like a voucher.  Missing time with family.  #family #precioustime
@AmericanAir there's a direct from Miami w a seat but u rebooked niece Tuesday. Can't get through on phones? #customerservicefail
@JetBlue just mine sadly.. But yea the fly fi is awesome
@USAirways you guys straight up suck ass
@USAirways @AmericanAir you know...hockey sticks are expensive. Your baggage handlers shouldn't just be throwing them on the cart.
@USAirways if my flight's been Cancelled Flightled, and I can't reach anyone over the phone or ticketing agents, safe to assume I wasn't rebooked?
@USAirways we got 1 drink then F/A sat in jump seat doing crosswords. Glasses picked up at landing. Just a very lazy service 4 First class.
@united 24 seats available on the 2:15 pm from ORD to RDU...I need 2 seats please
@united I'll be sending/posting complete details of the circumstances surrounding this matter.  United airlines should be ashamed.
@AmericanAir @USAirways I've tried to be understanding and let you handle the situation but I guess I was wrong about that
@VirginAmerica kinda sucked my earphone jack didn't work on my flight. They may want to look into that for future passengers
@JetBlue beautiful ride. Thanks again:)
.@AmericanAir ReFlight Booking Problems for the following day is unacceptable. DMing you that and our phone number.
@VirginAmerica All of group E was told there was no more room in the bins. when I got on the plane, was room for at least 4 bags in my row!
@VirginAmerica too bad you say it takes 10 to 14 days via YOUR confirmation email. When I inquired after 3 weeks you claim 6 to 8 weeks!
.@AmericanAir just disappointed with the Flight Booking Problems process and add‚Äôl fees to sit together on a more crowded flight. Not impressed so far :-/.
@USAirways problem with flight in Gainesville US Airways  5137 to CLT will miss connecting flight 5547 to IAD. When can I get another flight
@united I just sent a long note with some suggestions. Thanks for getting back to me.
@USAirways @Jack_Kairys your site clearly explains we are allowed a carry on. This was allowed at PIT but not BOS. How does that make sense?
@united Just boarded UA1297, was refused from carrying overhead bag as no space, in plane now with loads of space #fail #customerexperience
@JetBlue the TV. Wifi was spotty. It's just a nice feature for a X country flight. Still won't keep us away #lovejetblue
@united or did you mean 24-26?
@JetBlue Even 5 years after the earthquake...Haiti still needs helps in rebuilding #flyingitforward
@JetBlue I fly w/u as much as I can, however your kiosks were broken in SYR and there was 1 woman working the ticket counter.. She had a
@USAirways must be nice to take your customer service phone off the hook! #fendforyourself
@JetBlue hey you guys remembered lol! But now my BOS flights delayed... And turn the heat down in T5 it feels hotter than PR.
@SouthwestAir rocks! Open letter to flight attendant. http://t.co/zFrOINPSzI  &lt; my child was inspired.  Thank you.
@AmericanAir @DuaneNClark  ever think about being prepared and bringing in more people? Does anyone have any business sense at AA?
@AmericanAir do you still use DC9's?
@USAirways @usairways -Really? U land me in Philly 1.5 hours before my flight, wait 1.5 hours behind a plane you got stuck,
@SouthwestAir yes, very much so! I was looking forward to using your airlines for future flights but never again.
@united flight just Cancelled Flightled. This is ridiculous
@united after 2 days - 1 flight Cancelled Flightled, another delay for 8 hours- united gave me a $7 food voucher. That's how much they value my time??
@AmericanAir no. Prebook flight for wife's 40th bday in NO. I recently have had surgery and can't travel. Won't let another go in my place
@JetBlue haha. TY. Do you know what time that lane opens at Logan?
@JetBlue I would prefer a similar picture but full of E190 tails, but great shot!
@SouthwestAir no, thanks. I think we have it straight!
@USAirways I am good. I just did not understand the terminology.  but the merger brings new verbiage
@united UA6255 delayed out of #winnipeg because the plane was "frozen"! #fail Will I make my connection on UA1059? #tightconnection #Denver
@SouthwestAir 5 min away!
@united i got it at the gate, thanks for checking!
@AmericanAir checking into a flight on your website is about as easy as asking a bear to shit in a toilet #justsaying
@JetBlue sounds great! Thank you!! :)
@USAirways As a member of the news media, the awful service of the last few days won't go unnoticed.
@JetBlue what is the reason for the delay
@JetBlue The Opal Dragon book The Dragon (ALI) has woven his murdering ways from the Philippines to Australia http://t.co/ltwhmOL1Dr
@AmericanAir @Stone9956 Do you dislike delays when they're caused by YOUR crew forgetting to load bags &amp; lazy pilot wanting duty day to end?
@united - not only 2 hour delay - double booked seat nit parked at wrong gate - incompetence at its finest - been waiting  for over 1 hr
@united looking back - never heard from anyone - I had to call and frankly got standard SOP - still think about it today
@SouthwestAir no worries. We got thru eventually. I was just curious. Best of luck to you dealing with the weather!
@AmericanAir @USAirways over an hour on the phone the best you can tell me is it was sent maybe my bank misplaced it...
@jetblue - WTF, stuck at JFK for 2+ hrs in a delay to Boston cuz u say snow.  No snow on weather map!!!  WTF!!!
@AmericanAir exceptional customer service from AA - my misplaced item was waiting for me at checkin followed by a smooth flight. Thank you!
@JetBlue that is a stock response. Delays not as frustrating as poor cust serv &amp; being told by 3 ppl to wait &amp; they'd come back but did not.
@USAirways takes my money at once but then requires 7 to 10 days to process a refund? Why does your auto attendant hang up? #usairwaysfail
@AmericanAir submitted a case to AA customer relations two weeks ago, no word ever since! whats the point of even having CR?
@united why couldn't you have changed the tire of my delayed UA1127 flight when it arrived instead of waiting until boarding?
@USAirways #usairways Raleigh NC; baggage carousel staff were aggressive towards people waiting 1 1/2 hrs for bags. Flight 699
@JetBlue yep it's for tomorrow.
@USAirways platinum flyer bought tkt in AA. Also both accounts are linked. So WHY can't I check in for flight tomorrow?
@JetBlue great job getting flight 28 in 10 minutes early. Too bad we're at 50 minutes and counting waiting for our bags.
@VirginAmerica does Virgin America fly direct from Seattle to NYC or Boston?
@JetBlue BEST SEAT ON A E190 to board early. READY. SET. GO!
@united if I had a ticket refunded which I purchased, for my brother to fly...could I then used the refunded credit for me to fly? Respond
@SouthwestAir @matthewebel And this is why I love flying Southwest. Excellent service, and you don't take yourselves too seriously!
@USAirways after being assured by the pleasant woman at gate B11 in Albany, NY that life's not perfect, I'd heard enough.
@AmericanAir Yes, thanks I found those, didn't see the gray tab at first :)
@JetBlue i only take jetblue to travel and i have to go to maimi next year but you guys dont go to maimiüò≠ why dont you guys go to maimi???
@SouthwestAir I had to travel to Savannah, GA, once again, on an airline I don't "Luv". When r u going to fly me to Savannah? Pleeeease!!!!
@SouthwestAir Engadget Theverge Wired reddit
@united look at this beauty üòâ dc 10 united airlines üòâ http://t.co/MvYoizRPdE
@SouthwestAir My brother &amp; his girlfriend‚Äôs flight Cancelled Flightled 3 times, now leaving 72 hours Late Flight and dropping letter grades at school. Help?
@JetBlue I believe that the website said I could receive credit for upcoming flights since I Cancelled Flighted my last one. Is this true?
@AmericanAir The pilot admitted to us that this delay is entirely because of AA incompetence and poor equip checks.
@united never ever again will I be Flight Booking Problems a flight with United or any affiliate if there is a chance to get on a United flight
@VirginAmerica can‚Äôt access your website from Safari on iPhone 6. Seems to work on Mac and iPad. Need iPhone to add Passbook.
@USAirways please help! No bags, no way to get through to customer service since 8AM this morning! Help!!
@AmericanAir no I've since rebooked with another airline, what I would like is compensation for all the time/money lost!
@USAirways 1,223.22 of unusable funds. Will not book with you again. #usairwaysfailscustomers
@USAirways has no idea what customer service means.  As the customer, if you mess up my plans, don't treat me like its no big deal!
@AmericanAir Aww cool! It's nice to know they are still up above my head then. One of my faves.
@JetBlue ruining vacations left and right. Who would have thought an airline can Cancelled Flight tickets without telling the buyer
@united so, not only were you Late Flight, you broke my luggage handle. You paying for a new one? http://t.co/nYVV1X3d67
@JetBlue thanks for update http://t.co/K7uBOTMr1r
@AmericanAir But you called me - and hung up.
@AmericanAir after running from one flight, because we had 10 mins, to our next flight, we then sat on our plane for an hour.
@SouthwestAir confirmation number for new reservation is FP9M6Y I am traveling with a 3 year old. please email? jennifer.cascino@gmail.com
@AmericanAir . Death of a dear friend has me heart broken but #AmericanAirlines has me heated!
@USAirways we even offered to fly in to another airport and they said they couldn't do that. No explanation why they can't.
@united terrible service for military members and their families. #ridiculous #UnitedAirlines
@AmericanAir my husband and 5 year old son stuck overnight in DC thanks to 7 crew members arguing over who was boarding the flight
@USAirways Emailed them a week ago and still nothing...
@SouthwestAir please send me a number to call to talk to a person and not be put on hold
@USAirways any idea when flight 703 to Miami will leave for a second time?
@AmericanAir your customer service is a disgrace.
@united thank you
@united just called and did it. Should have earlier because I'm being sent to DCA first and THEN to pvd. We may rent a car instead.
@JetBlue Love your airline...hate your website.  Just tried to book 2 tickets (1 w miles, 1 w/out).  Absolute joke.   Needs a lot of work!
@united my last call your customer service agent called me back... As he was stuck on hold to air Canada.. Just hope he's booked me a flight
@SouthwestAir We should be landing at RIC right now, but haven't even left ATL. Should have picked Delta maybe?
.@USAirways worst experience of all time. Will never, ever, ever travel with you again. EVER
@USAirways yes, it's a domestic flight. Thank you!
@SouthwestAir I thank you for the reply but too complicated to DM, really would like to talk to a cust rep. What is going on there?
@USAirways if you could have ran your USExpress/PSA worth a damn I wouldn't be stuck in horrible CLT now.
@VirginAmerica why is flight 345 redirected?
@united so I wasted 40mins filling in 2 online forms you are telling me you didn't receive, how do I know this won't happen this time?
@AmericanAir Okay, I think 1565 has waited long enough for a gate at DFW...
@USAirways check in at St. Louis is so rude, even the TSA is nicer than them.
@SouthwestAir do we have a time estimate for our luggage? we'll be sure to fill out your survey!!
@VirginAmerica trying to check-in...but looks like your site is down?
@SouthwestAir Already rebooked for tomorrow. Fingers crossed!
@united airlines claims to have a low fare guarantee, but they won't honor a lower fare that I found.
@AmericanAir DM the locator code, thanks.
@USAirways @AskPayPal completed. If that's the case then why does it still say "in progress" on Paypal's website. I reserved on the 13th.
@USAirways why have me board a plane knowing there is a maint issue?  US5235.
@AmericanAir  thanks hoping that by wed I can get back to DFW
@AmericanAir You don't have those abilities anywhere! Not at the ticket counter, at cust service, or online. That's why we're done here.
@SouthwestAir thinks that a $100 voucher makes up for spending 4 hrs on a plane and landing at the same airport we took off from. Really?
@SouthwestAir - I get that weather delays are not in your hands, but is there nothing else you can offer for the massive inconvenience?
@AmericanAir dmed the name
@VirginAmerica What is the reason  for the delay of the departure of VX 413 from JFK this afternoon?
@USAirways you guys Cancelled Flightled two of my flights yesterday and I checked the bag to Huntsville and it went missing in Philly.
@united followed you and DM'd you
@united call wait times are over 20 minutes and airport wait times are longer
@united of the airplane otherwise they would call the Police, because the flight had to take off before 12h30am
@AmericanAir I have a ticket that has been pending for 4 days. Is it normal to take that long?? I want to make sure there isn't a problem.
@JetBlue That is not very gracious of @jetblue to tell me where I can go BUY water or a snack when our flight is delayed over 3 hours.
@USAirways bad weather shouldn't mean bad service
@AmericanAir @dfwairport got rebooked through the AA online app.
@VirginAmerica thanks so much for sharing. Just added it to my site http://t.co/TsviBTvT8h
@SouthwestAir been waiting for 70 minutes on hold because yall Cancelled Flightled my return flight. Answer the phone!!!
UA3388 @united was Cancelled Flightled not delayed.  Re-Flight Booking Problems still 90 miles from home.  At least acknowledge the Cancelled Flightlation.
@JetBlue well, the last update was in the right direction, at least! I'll keep my fingers crossed.
@VirginAmerica Can't bring up my reservation online using Flight Booking Problems code
@AmericanAir upgraded to 1st class. Inquired about red wine.  "Sauvignon blanc &amp; I can't pronounce the other one."  Couldn't describe...
@AmericanAir flight 3056 DFW still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded
@southwestair#SWADiversity We are ready to be inspired! http://t.co/S3EsW5AgUm
@SouthwestAir yeah haha. Never been in one. It's expensive üòÇüòÇ and we will!!!!! So much fun! #destinationdragons
@AmericanAir @united just deplaned at O'Hare gate K13. Why don't you send a customer service rep to discuss my situation? God knows...
@AmericanAir okay. I just sent it.
@SouthwestAir yes but not with out an attitude and nasty comment
@united lost bag on next flight. Didn't have time to load during the 5 hour delay?Consequence from platinum to gold
@JetBlue your website is seriously horrible and so is your  call center!! Almost makes it tempting to fly someone else!! #sodone
@SouthwestAir snapchat, iMessage, instagram......
@SouthwestAir Your crew on 3138 is doing a great job of keeping everyone informed during the delays #givethemraises
@USAirways How the heck does one get the Internet desk to authorize a waiver? Would that involved being on hold for another hour?
@USAirways What is with your lost &amp; found.  My wife lost her phone in Philly, &amp; followed your web instructions to call an 800#.  No answer.
@SouthwestAir Sorry! Thought I did. It's done now.
@AmericanAir congrats on your call center customer service! A guy named Fidencio answered and he went above &amp; beyond to help me! üëåüëåüëå
@southwestair #ftw! ‚úàÔ∏è Hope they'll sing us a song on our flight to Phoenix today. (@ Terminal 2 (Humphrey)) https://t.co/mAvIgetbBw
@united I don't know what DM the confirmation number means.
@SouthwestAir just announced non-stop flights to Dallas from Columbus. Well next time @iGotMonte best you'll have less time airport hopin üòÇüòÇ
@united reinstating the kosher meals that were dropped shortly after the merger?
@USAirways 8 hrs of wait time is unbelieavle unaccpetable biggest airline in the world should have failback call centers
@united I appreciate the immediate offer, but suspect it is more long-term issue/not simple fix. Also, ski/bootbag policy is awkward at best
@USAirways found great prices thru US Air for honeymoon. Website wont work and been on hold for more than a hour now after being told 10 min
Why @JetBlue let someone from black Twitter in their multimedia department?
@SouthwestAir weren't too "sincere" when you Cancelled Flighted my flight and made me drive 17 hours to get home..
@united Thanks!
@USAirways This is the worst flying experience of my life. Flight scheduled for departure at 5:44pm from Phl. 5+ hrs Late Flightr guess where I am?
@SouthwestAir Maybe if you comped those that quietly accepted delays or Cancelled Flightations instead of the irate you'd have less issues #justsaying
@united - after having to now TAG MY OWN bags at the airport I was hoping they would actually arrive WITH me - here's hoping they arrive
@AmericanAir this is the biggest joke I've ever seen and will be telling everyone never to use you guys cause you are a joke
@SouthwestAir sure,I'll send a message now!
@USAirways So far....my phone wait time is longer than @ABCNetwork's #Oscars coverage. #WhatCustomerService
@VirginAmerica Dear Virgin customer, while you're stranded in SF for 3 days &amp; $1000cost- we'll do the very least we can to accommodate you!
@USAirways very disappointed I wasn't "allowed" to change seats after checking in early online for a flight tomorrow morning.
@united Allright! Last question : the power outlets on my flight are available in the premium cabin. Does that include economy plus cabin?
.@USAirways I guess from now on I should take my chances &amp; keep the $50 for the courtesy free because it seems cabin is always full.
@AmericanAir it isn't good enough. You need to provide a phone number. Other partners do. Should be investigated by @IATA @TheFAAOnline
@AmericanAir how nice it would be if you had helpful flight attendants instead of the rude nasty ones you employ. #WhyAreYouYelling
@USAirways thank u i wiil write after call  travel agency
@united so disgusted and disappointed with united airlines luggage policies and attitude toward musicians. Unacceptable
@JetBlue don't worry, I'm gonna share with my row! üòÅ
@united Flight 211/ORD gate agent tried to prevent me from taking onboard a bag I've used for 15 years! Flight crew was more reasonable!
@AmericanAir I really can't there though to an agent, and I am worried about my reservation. Can you help me out!
@USAirways How long does it take to receive ticket # from @AmericanAir for itin booked via http://t.co/79waJk7EyT on US flights?
@AmericanAir thanks to FA Shawn for spectacular service on FLT 79 LHRDFW and to FA Susan for such a warm engaging onboard welcome
@USAirways You have no idea how upset and frustrated I am right now. I'll be sure to follow through with never flying with you again.
@JetBlue from San Diego with a 4 hour delay to JFK!Even you have a Amex  JetBlue, even having over 50.000 travel miles, you're still nothing
@SouthwestAir had a great LA flight with Clarence and Frank! Those 2 guys are a hoot! üòúüòÇ thanks
@USAirways if I apply for ur credit card, do you automatically get the companion certificate or do I have to wait for it?
@united  18 flights so far this year. 13 delays including 2 Cancelled Flightations.  Late Flightst reason, crew needed mandatory sleep. IN MEXICO!
@USAirways I gave up http://t.co/2eDgc6TbLs
@united If a business decision is made that inconveniences and possibly causes lost customers, is it a good business decision? #Cranky
@united I sent you a dm hours ago
@AmericanAir seats that were assigned are inappropriate for child this age. AA knew age of child.
@united ^GJ flight 1101 didn't have wifi even though it was promised to by your ground crew. #AnotherDisappointment
@USAirways US 728 Wait, now a gate opened. Back we go. (Good, maybe we can get off.)
@JetBlue According to your ground staff, it hasn't even been taken off the plane yet!
@united you suck.    9 hour delay?!
@USAirways where is your email address? Its not on this page: http://t.co/5cwH1yfOow
@United UA1740. As the inbound flight dep time gets closer you push it back 15 min. You've been doing this for 2 hrs.
@virginamerica Well, I didn't‚Ä¶but NOW I DO! :-D
@JetBlue @JayVig I like the inflight snacks! I'm flying with you guys on 2/28! #JVMChat
@USAirways This is ridiculous. You delayed my husband's flights &amp; made him miss his connection. Told him to leave his bags. Sent him (1/3)
@united  always a fucken nightmare with your airline. #fail #lazy #alwaysLate Flight #worstairlineever
@united same day flights
@JetBlue and the 20min line I stood in to drop my bag off?
@SouthwestAir prove it, Cuz the southwest people here don't even know why it's behind schedule.
@united She met me from customer service at the arrival of flight UA3787 PVD-IAD. Thanks, you guys have really handled this storm!
@AmericanAir I was rebooked on a flight that was too Late Flight for my connection!
@USAirways it was 1838, almost 5 hours Late Flight due  to mechanical.
@AmericanAir flight attendants on AA2402 were spectacular.Fed the ENTIRE cabin then food from coach. Why do you keep serving this vile food
@united thank you! Good service, safe flight... 1/2 way home!
@SouthwestAir @SAMoore10 Thank you for your kind response.  The acknowledgement and apology go a long way! #southwestrocks
@SouthwestAir There's nothing I love more than being on hold for over an hour http://t.co/LIQWoblFbT
@AmericanAir @emrey35 But it says your agents are too busy and to try back Late Flightr???
@USAirways OK, I guess the weather has been rough but I have been trying to sort out missing air-miles for days. Any suggestions?
@united DM sent as requested. Make sure you follow back so you can DM me back. Thanks
@AmericanAir Hopefully you guys are willing to cover my lovely car rental and living charges...I love being here for two extra days..
@AmericanAir my itinerary was from EWR TO DALLAS to LA. You Cancelled Flightled my flight, you have my money, find a way to get me there from EWR
@SouthwestAir On my flight today from RSW to GRR I was able to snag a free SW Agent to check for me. It looks like we are (finally) all set.
@united sent a DM just now. Thanks I am incredibly happy the fast response I got via Twitter than via customer care. Thank you
@AmericanAir yeah, buy me a @Delta plane ticket from San Diego to Detroit so I can fly one of their planes home tomorrow
@united if you don't like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much?
@USAirways let's say it's directly correLate Flightd to the chance of a replacement case. I know which would cost the airline less!
@USAirways Gave up after more than 2 hours on hold. Still need that receipt; last time it was promised, it never arrived. Help?!
@JetBlue ah yes. Put the bags on the floor instead of the overhead bin so no one trips. #safetyfirst #sarcasm
@VirginAmerica you guys are perfect as always! &lt;3 #WeRVirgin
@USAirways Yes, I get that. I‚Äôm asking: Specifically, what will you do with the feedback I‚Äôve given you?
@SouthwestAir yall still fly in the cold right?
@SouthwestAir  3 flights yesterday; no treats but nuts and pretzels. Also no origami in the magazine. New policies? #OldPoliciesWayBetter
@AmericanAir oh I did. All I received back was an email saying " delays happen".. Uh huh..
@VirginAmerica - Let 2 scanned in passengers leave the plane than told someone to remove their bag from 1st class bin? #uncomfortable
üòÇüòÇ RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/rinzYSK6kI
@USAirways @marvinatorsb thnk you for response,all flights were full, couldn't get out until tmrw, had to Cancelled Flight and go w/other airline
@USAirways another bad experience today.  Frozen pipes on 597.  Missing connection.
@SouthwestAir That guy was the flight attendant on my last flight‚Ä¶ he was hilarious! ‚ò∫
@AmericanAir the most stressful morning and still had to pay to check a bag. LAX is a madhouse with a lot of angry customers. Yikes
@united thanks for having changed me. Managed to arrive with only 8 hours of delay and exhausted
@JetBlue But not reddit? I work for the site and this is ridiculous.
@united. DAY to IAD and CVG to IAD both Cancelled Flightled by United but all other airlines operating. Friend stuck and now miss intl flight. Help?
@JetBlue great trip today!  Thanks to the crew flying us home, they were fantastic! http://t.co/sk6W9XQaQB
@SouthwestAir thank you so much completely made things right!
@united Pleased to be a Premier Platinum
@AmericanAir 3days and no call,bag or anyone to pick up my call. Held on ph til 130 am and holding again now. Insane,#help
@united - Why can't I get a boarding pass for my Austrian Airlines codeshare flight. Rebook incls a 6 hour layover &amp; I am stuck outside sec
@USAirways @AmericanAir hey since you    f*%#ed my wknd can I have day pass to admirals club or meal coupon or free coke? {blank stare}
@SouthwestAir: Tried for VIP Live in The Vineyard but yr site went down, by the time I got in 2 redeem pts those packages gone.
@united Blackmailed me into paying ¬£130 extra or having my return ticket nullified in San Francisco Airport. Terrible service from rep #scam
@USAirways being told 'tough break and this is how it is' is unacceptable. You can't even tell me when my bags will be here
@SouthwestAir DM Sent.
@united Listen, learn &amp; do this: Remove your PQD requirement. It is insulting. ^HA
@JetBlue That's pretty nice. Are flight credits automatically given after the flight? I also wish there were a lounge I could sleep in.
@SouthwestAir great now we are all de boarding perfectly plane is shot. Fml. Plans are screwed. Thanks for nothing @SouthwestAir
@USAirways ur "response" was: my "inconvenience was of no matter." U wanted me sit for 3 xtra nights in the city w/out comp! #donotflyusair
@JetBlue Oh that totally looks on par with @AmericanAir's Admirals Club; any way you can slide us a couple passes? ;)
@USAirways express my disappointment in your reservation department and the treatment of a Sailor dealing with a death in the family
@USAirways thanks is there a beareavement discount anymore or not should I just book online
@AmericanAir Flight 35. I'm on my way.
@united 3 times I've called customer services each at least 40 mins... Each time cut off by your operators... Why can't you call me back!
@SouthwestAir  you are over 40, please start acting your age and stop with the short-shorts!
@USAirways I've been on hold at the reservations desk for 3 hours. HELP!!!!
@united leadership counts. landed at 11:15 last night-deplaned at 12:40. 45 minutes of that was waiting for the jetway. Inexcusable
@AmericanAir How can I get a flight change while in the air? Delays causing a missed connection again. There is 1 seat for Late Flightr
Thanks, @chasefoster. Was just about to book a flight to UK using @AmericanAir, but after reading this exchange, there's no way. I've sent
@VirginAmerica Trying to reset my password, email never arrives. Help?
@united I'm not sure you can do anything as this has been building up over time! Other than promises from your CEO service has gotten worse!
@united done. Want me to send a screen shot of the second call, which is now at over 45 minutes?
Thanks @united. @imran_r44 had a question about the wait time for baggage on UA6366
@AmericanAir When I left Orlando, I was 2nd in line for standby. I land and I'm 4th. 'Priority members get first available seats'. Awesome.
@SouthwestAir :( Thanks for the opportunity...
@SouthwestAir I'm flying out of CUN tomorrow To DEN - can I change my flight due to the travel advisory??
@SouthwestAir sitting in Baltimore. Finish taxi and approved to takeoff. Oops, not enough fuel. #Fail #45minflight #been3hours
@JetBlue thanks! I only loose 'em at airports...1st time we found it. I think @fitbit needs to make flexes that stay on when carrying bags!
@AmericanAir But when becomes about get money from the passengers are very strict but don't have ANY feedback as a reward
@united round trip*
@united I see you coming to get me and @AggieMensGolf in Hawaii! #12thMan http://t.co/G8DKa3Edhf
@AmericanAir Flight's Cancelled Flightled. Website says to call phone number.Phone says to check online.  How am I supposed to get some help?
@SouthwestAir Flying South by Southwest from SJC to SNA tiday http://t.co/KJKuVJ6CMo
@USAirways No one answers your reservation phone line. I need to book travel with a  companion certificate. How do I get through?!!!
@JetBlue why is the buffalo flight so Late Flight?
@SouthwestAir - Great flight from Phoenix to Dallas tonight!Great service and ON TIME! Makes @timieyancey very happy! http://t.co/TkVCMhbPim
@SouthwestAir its flight #218 of that matters to you all. Hell next we all won't get our luggage properly transferred #facepalm #smh
@AmericanAir @MattThomasNews When did American Airlines start flying to and from Siberia? Wait, this is the USA? Oy!
@AmericanAir ask the 10 people you left behind at Miami airport because you guys could not wait 5 minutes and ... http://t.co/XPM98Igqjn
@JetBlue you bet:)
@SouthwestAir yes please
@united ok thanks. I sent you a DM too. You can disregard that.
@AmericanAir can I DM you info?
@SouthwestAir my golf bag was broken on the flight I just took. What's the process for damage reimbursement?
@AmericanAir cost me 1 day of #vacation ($350) and all I got was a rude woman tell me to go to another country and figure out how to get...
@JetBlue didn't work. Fly-fi plus couldn't access ABC app. So I spent $19 and still missed Oscars. #disappointed
@united rep wouldn't rebook. This is such a waste of time and poor communication
@americanair been calling your for 4+ hours to reschedule a flight to #DFW due to weather and your won't even let me stay on hold.....
@united I was flying home for a 9:30am event tomorrow. You pushed back my flight. Now I have a $400 ticket that won't get me home in time.
@AmericanAir Late Flight from phoenix, gave ticks away when arrived chicago, held bags hostage chicago, rented van drove to toledo. 5 hr drive.
@USAirways @AmericanAir my friends are stranded at KPHL and the representatives there won't even give them food vouchers‚Ä¶any help please?
@USAirways and that you can choose the same seat for free after clicking 100 buttons.
@united Thanks. UA1121, DEN, 40 min on tarmac.
@USAirways Why were we loaded onto the plane (4 hours Late Flight, mind you), made to sit for 40 minutes
@AmericanAir boom. http://t.co/PzGc6Jch7n
@united yes, we've been with the agents for the last 50 minutes. One of the agents have been very rude, but thankfully Ladan has been nice.
@united is it even legal for you guys to advertise flights that you cant honor??
@AmericanAir I have not. There's no option for even getting a call back!
@SouthwestAir When does the new schedule open that takes us past 10/31?
@united thank you so much, that helps a ton. Whoever is on this Twitter acct today deserves a handshake and a hot chocoLate Flight. #problemsolvers
@USAirways. wow, awful customer service.
@AmericanAir if I could fly an md80/dc10 I would be so happy I live that plane so much md80 is love md80 is life.
@SouthwestAir I wanted to thank the great efforts of Jamie McKinnie in BUF she is a true pro! during major delays she was owning it! #raise
@united thanks for your attention. I would actually like to make a specific complaint about customer service at DCA. What is my best option?
@SouthwestAir it says I can't because my flight is in progress.
@AmericanAir trying to get thru to agent since last night b/c AA changed our flight to 2 days from now. Infuriating! We need to get to SEA!
@united I was on hold for over 20 minutes and was talking to one of your employees. I asked him for name or id # and he hung up in my face!
@AmericanAir @GolfWithWoody Don't buy it, Woody. They're making it MUCH worse with understaffing, rudeness, and pre-rookie mistakes
@united why do you hire POS pilots? Thanks for ruining my trip and not allowing me to see my buddy as he turns 30. #unitedsucksdick
@united we are delayed in San Pedro, Belize. We are scheduled to fly out at 3pm from Belize City to Houston. Will you wait please?
@AmericanAir @kanne822 @SouthwestAir is better than AA.
@AmericanAir I love travel with yours planes, all people is very nice, it's amazing! Can you please follow me back? üòãI love the company!
@VirginAmerica requested window seat and confirmed window but got stuck in middle seat. Not a good way to treat silver memberüòí
@USAirways I already did. My question is, why does it still say in progress on @AskPayPal? It's been 6 days.
@USAirways I can't believe that you would refer me to a number no one seems to be getting through. Really? I need help ASAP!
@SouthwestAir All good... beers and #oscars2015 ar #DIA
@united very disappointed in CC. Purchased ticket online w/ voucher and charge full amnt. Would not hold price after refund. Unacceptable
@JetBlue Call was not made by the inflight crew. They in fact asked us why we didn't bring it on.
@SouthwestAir Ahhhh! Sorry, just followed.
@united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?
@united i'm glad u can solve the prob. But my experience remains - will not fly again on #United
@united I have.
@JetBlue insane the craziness I've seen with Jet Blue today at Newark Delayed 3 hours and now we are waiting for a Pilot!! #jetblue
@USAirways haha no worries you guys are the best!  +1 for spelling my name correctly
@SouthwestAir - Hi Janet in customer service. I'm calling you back and have been sitting in que for 40 mins! Plz pick it up!!! #frustrated
@USAirways it is my fault but i bought online and i get twice why i buy twice it fault but i bougth ticket jfk to mccaren and usairways ++
@VirginAmerica what happened to direct flights from SFO-FLL? Looking in May, only see connecting #help #dontdothistome
@USAirways yep, check it and my gmail 'Promotions' folder regularly... :-(
@USAirways well that is not going to help. I'vebeen on hold over 3 hrs &amp; my client wants his ff nbr in the record he's elite wAA
@USAirways We take Late Flight to a whole new level!
@USAirways Thks 4 tip. Seems like a workaround rather than a customer-friendly solution. They should have an easily accessible email.
@united I'm a first time solo female traveller and it's pretty scary being in a foreign place not knowing where your belongings are...
@united why are your SFO-&gt;BOS nonstop flights not competitively priced with those of JetBlue and Virgin? $179 vs $324. Identical times.
@AmericanAir can u help rebook passenger via Twitter/DM.  Been on hold for 1.5 hours. Thanks!
@united never fails, flying FC order ravioli get chicken. Tell the FA she says you should of told me, other people wanted chicken..idiot.
@JetBlue window exits give it away.
@SouthwestAir are ur flight still Cancelled Flight from nashville tn today and tomorrow to Dallas TX? I been waiting on phone to ur office for 40 min.
@AmericanAir those were snacks we left on purpose for your team. :) for being so helpful this morning at the desk and on the phone!
@JetBlue we made it safe and sound. Thank you for the safe travels.
@USAirways not Cancelled Flightling #837 because you don't want to put us in a hotel for night is our guess
@JetBlue honestly I‚Äôm glad you didn‚Äôt Cancelled Flight the flight, just that I‚Äôll be driving home at 3-4 am now. :/
@AmericanAir thanks
@JetBlue Hold for 15 min, a couple of rings, then "mailbox has not been set up yet." Customer service forwarding to their cell phones? C'mon
@JetBlue thanks!!
@AmericanAir On flt 1627 from DFW to FAT on 2/23 and it was 86'd. Can you rebook me on the 1359 flight tonight? Can't get through on phone.
@united you phone customer service team is bad. Think it is time for me to consider switching airlines.
@USAirways @PHLAirport Cancelled Flighted flight due to weather no problem, but wait for luggage for 4 hours?? IT MUST BE DELIVERED!!
@USAirways I'm sure the people are working very hard, but the systems should assist with IVR prompting, offering call backs, hold wait times
@united appreciate getting put on hold for 20min and then getting hung up on because I was requesting help for big group. I'll try #Delta
@united yes to more food! Add some gluten free options while you're at it
@SouthwestAir I called the 800 # and the rep there was pleasant but less than helpful! Told me I was SOL. Train them for consistent #CX!
@united u lost my bag and would not refund my bag fee? Does that make sense to you? And yes I already called cust svc. They said no.
@USAirways @united each says the other has my luggage. On hold almost 3.5 hrs with @USAirways. @united hung up 3x. http://t.co/dr5oCtp1DY
@united worst AIRLINE BEWARE THEY DO NOT MAINTAIN THERE PLAIN BEEN ON THE RUNWAY THE PAST 4 HOURS!!!/
@USAirways I have sent letter after letter and get back nothing but form letters and half baked reply's #usairwaysssuck
@USAirways Used 2 get emails 1) pre-purchase a snack and 2) when time to check in. Got neither 4 tomorrow's trip. Do they not get sent now?
@united I've sent the message, let me know if you got it. I'm not very twitter-literate. Also, is he REALLY going to be stuck for 18hrs?
@USAirways @AmericanAir stranded in cold Texas and getting sick because you overbooked the flight and gave my seat away. #gooutofbusiness
@USAirways or is anyone even responding to social media? AWFUL.
@SouthwestAir yea but I was hoping to avoid the ticket difference amount as a birthday courtesy? #flysouthwest #lovesouthwest #mybday
@JetBlue How can I check that? I do not believe I was given a credit for that automatically. :/
@united Sure did! Only waited about 15min. Yay!
@united thanks for prompt response.  Another hour to enjoy vacation! Perhaps a bug in the app as it still shows 2:55.
@united You really should clean the food and coffee stains off of the area around the seats when new passengers come aboard. Gross!
@united Thanks. It is on the same ticket.
@united I did they did not.  I did submit a complaint on line and never heard back from that - I don't have that ID- you should find it
@united - Plane came in with broken seat.  Rather than fix it they put a broken sign on it and separated me from my kids.
@AmericanAir Well if you won't let me handle my reservation/change online, &amp; your Reservation call # hangs up on me wtf do I do?? Bullshit.
@JetBlue Did you discontinue nonstop service from SJC to BOS? Can't find 471 or 472 anywhere
@AmericanAir it's not just frustrating--it was PAID for! how do we get a refund?
@SouthwestAir replacing @vitaminwater with beer! Bravo!üëèüëè Cheers! üçªüçª @Leinenkugels @DosEquis @FatTire
@SouthwestAir DM sent.  Thank you.
@united 1627 to Montego Bay going back to gate bc 1person was Late Flight? Awful service for all of who came on time!!
@AmericanAir She could even see that I had tried to make the transaction but wouldn't offer me the price I'd tried to purchase it at.
@SouthwestAir loved it!
@USAirways I got up at 2 am for a 5 am flight from bos to Charlotte which I found was Cancelled Flightled once I got to the gate (1)
@SouthwestAir yes. Hung up and called a different number.
@united amazing flying over 25,000 miles on #UnitedAirlines &amp; alliance last year; still got jilted out of status! #moneyelsewhere
@virginamerica awesome deals DAL-AUS for only $39 each way! https://t.co/xCVQXYkg49
@AmericanAir second pic from CDG?
@SouthwestAir got an email confirmation of wifi purchase on a recent flight. Trouble is, I've never flown with you. Ever. #concerned #scam?
@JetBlue I've had no shampoo, no winter coat no deodorant no flatiron and the rest if my stuff since sat
@USAirways Oh yes, because I had loads of time running to my connecting flight after you delayed me for about 90 minutes...
@JetBlue @julesdameron "Considering?" #Accessibility is an absolute MUST! #Equality
@VirginAmerica just promoting the product is all, had a problem with southwest and recommend noneother than the best! http://t.co/tFaNXBh1Cf
@united is not a company that values it's customer &amp; after reading tweets to them I'm not the only one who feels that way #lostmybusiness
@JetBlue Airways Now Covered by Bank of America (JBLU) - Dakota Financial News http://t.co/WOwxhpU5qv
@united Just sent a DM. Thank you for the acknowledgment.
@SouthwestAir Should be a way to give voice to customers who pay for services that are not satisfactorily delivered. #justsayin
@SouthwestAir had a very rude gate agent at BWI tonight gate B8 after a 6.5hr delay for flight 1172. I think a little training is in order.
@USAirways paid to upgrade to first class, went up to Admirals club at PHX airport to be turned away because our flight is to CUN and not MC
@USAirways @AmericanAir no one appreciates the sass of the gate agent at Gate C38 at LGA flight US626. Irritated customers
@USAirways you've completely ruined a pro athlete's ability to prepare for a race. Now you won't help him get the bike he needs to the DR?!
@USAirways strikes again--Late Flight crew #3/4 for the trip and maintenance #2/4.  Worth the extra $200/trip for less hassle and fewer delays
@united I'm 0/3 for Flight Booking Problems without major problems. 0% isn't bad!üëéüëé
@SouthwestAir sent
@united thanks. Just a program comment; the system assigned seats behind each other even though pairs were available. I changed it back.
@AmericanAir flight US1562 from RIC2DFW was Cancelled Flightled yesterday &amp; I was on hold w/ cust. service from 6-10pm EST...4 hours, no answer...

@JetBlue what is the Mosiac 800 #?
@united those whose pay to actually fly with you over 30k/ year deserve better service than a CC holder.
@united. Once again your lack of customer centricity us astounding
@JetBlue For my Grandma Ella's 80th, she would love a birthday greeting from your flight crew! She was a stewardess for Eastern Airlines.
@AmericanAir will not let me reuse my ticket.  Thus I have booked my vacation with Delta!  Never flying on American again......
@JetBlue I'm going to write a post on @Medium about the experience. Your customer service has tanked. #JetBlue
@southwestair. So important to accept others for who they are. #SWADiversity
@JetBlue When it's 30 mins past scheduled time w/ no departure in sight a flight no longer qualifies as "on time" #updateyourwebsite #489
@USAirways did a pre schooler develop your app? The thing crashes every single time.
@united too long for 140 characters
@united Good luck with the no-enertainment-on-6-hour-flights strategy. Innovation at work. Hello @jetblue http://t.co/HI76BOavXY
@united any chance you could look into my problem from earlier?
@SouthwestAir my sister&amp;brother in law need to get to Florida desperately flying w/ @USAirways is there anything you can do?
@SouthwestAir, remember me? Wouldn't let me on 3:05pm flight (seats available). Now my 7:40 flight is delayed. Worst airline. #badservice
@SouthwestAir Thanks 4 the great service, staff, letting me change my flight 5 times for free! PVD to the skies for me always on SWA!
@USAirways am 2. 1/2 hours from airport sure would like to talk to someone
@JetBlue well, now saying our flight is going to be Cancelled Flighted &amp; that by not changing earlier, we missed our chance to get out tomorrow. 1/2
@JetBlue how can we get help with a hotel we booked with you and are having issues with.
@united as a 1k, I'm always hoping for improvement.
@JetBlue can I get some more leg room tonight B6 304
@JetBlue wow, keeping up with the times...
@united Why can I only apply one travel certificate per itinerary even when I have multiple flights?
@SouthwestAir I have followed you. Awaiting your DM.
@JetBlue thank you for the information.
@JetBlue Appreciate the heads up at 10:45 that my 11am flight was delayed bc the crew is stuck in Boston #communicationFAIL #dobetterJetBlue
@united Thanks to supervisor Miriam who provided me with great customer service. #finally

@SouthwestAir Thank you so much for stepping up your game and making my day after night of elevator music. Much appreciated.
@USAirways and at this point I don't need sorry, I need a revers agt to pick up the call so maybe we can make the 11:30 flight today
@USAirways it was supposed to be a carry on and in Pittsburgh  coming to Boston it was a carry on
@united I wonder if sharing all this on FB and insta would produce a number. 140 characters really limits my story telling.
@united lol too little too Late Flight
@united Resolved. Over hour of work on  ground &amp; somehow the system reset itself during takeoff. I appreciate the quick response/service.
@united stay warm - I will be passing through Chicago next week

@SouthwestAir can't DM you without you following me...
@JetBlue my mom wanted me to change her seat along with my sister, but their two different reservations and idk
@united You cause me to miss my flight telling me it already left when it had not. No empathy from gate staff or crew, no apology. Really?
@JetBlue thank you for not even coming with a solution. Great service I might say...as a TrueBlue member I am totally dissatisfied...thanks
@SouthwestAir bos to msp, msp to aus, aus to bos. Site doesn't seem to display fields for the middle trip when I add the 3rd.
@SouthwestAir I managed to get sorted out over the phone. Good luck dealing with the snow in Texas!
@USAirways Don't blame it on weather. Rep at counter cost me entire day - not weather.  Printed Boarding Pass too Late Flight. #TakeResponsibility
@USAirways: I experienced what defines customer service on #FLT1999. A flight attendant willing to follow up with a passenger on bag charges
@JetBlue you know it!!
@JetBlue this is not a flight delay this is horrible planning on Jet Blue!!! #jetblue
@USAirways call Gate D9 in CLT and get me on this flight
@united I am not digging the new mileage earning plan. I would earn about 1/3 of the miles I do now. Any changes to the award ticket prices?
@JetBlue ok, tx. Will tell the guy sitting next to me at the gate
@VirginAmerica I'm pulling my hair out trying to book a flight with u. Your site doesn't work on iPhone or iPad.don't have a computer #help
@AmericanAir Flight 4606 from MEM to DCA delayed 6 hours! Now holding breath while they keep me trapped 3 hours to de-ice. #scareair
@JetBlue Yep. 1 hour at Logan. Gangway broke and cabin crew stuck on plane. They just arrived. Passengers request butt massages.
@AmericanAir a free check bag a food comp a flying credit something to help out now that I'm an additional 200 dollars in the hole
@united help? Invest more in your planes and your people and less in stock buybacks and executive pay. Maybe then you would not disappoint.
@AmericanAir your maint delay left us stuck in den!! Flight 1080.  Been on plane for 7 hrs.  Stop flying broke french planes!
@SouthwestAir I did, but no one can find the bag and we need everything in it in the next two hours.
@united didn't realize my bag/ contents were wet until I got to my hotel. Sent my suit/shirts out to be dry cleaned. Mtgs start tomorrow.

@SouthwestAir i have asked Lindsey to call me instead of DM like a schoolgirl but so far no call   Getting tired of typing little notes
@AmericanAir I've been trying to get through to reservations since yesterday to make a change to a reservation hold, when will it be up?
@united will do. Thank you!
@USAirways I finally spoke to a person. Despite the mind boggling wait time, the rep was very pleasant and very helpful. Kudos to her.
@USAirways We've been on hold for over 7 hours after my wife's flight was Cancelled Flighted.
@SouthwestAir Another great flight &amp; crew, Las Vegas-Chicago #3397. Thanks!
@united plus what about food? And taxis?
@AmericanAir @Delta @JetBlue I am going to be stuck in Florida for 3 days because @SpiritAirlines wouldn't hold my connecting flight to LGA
@USAirways I will be traveling from LAX to CLT to HTS, I have been rebooked for tomorrow due to the travel advisory.
@SouthwestAir no need, I know the status, you Cancelled Flightled instead of delaying the flight.
@USAirways rudest crew member experience! Throwing shade and calling out customers. #reachingnewlows
@JetBlue ok!!! That's super helpful. Thank you. I'll reach out if I have any other questions.
@united just DM'd

@united you need a bag bouncer. Get it together
@USAirways over an hour is unacceptable wait time. thanks for nothing.  Be sure never to fly you again
@VirginAmerica thank you for the easy itinerary shift for impending weather. Quick, painless &amp; free.
@united so, I made it all the way to the airport, and they say they won‚Äôt fix the handle. I showed you this problem, and you said to go‚Ä¶?
@united how about 3659 YUL-ORD?
@USAirways now the freezing bus is just doing circles?
@USAirways pilot tells me that all @AmericanAir and US Airways flights across the country have stopped due to a computer system failure.
@SouthwestAir currently rebooked thru Dallas but I hear they are expecting an ice storm (sigh) #strandedNYC
@united why doesn't my daughter, booked with my gold member miles, get on the upgrade list for her flight tomorrow?
@JetBlue just sat on a plane for 3 hours in Dulles #insane #ijustwanttobeinBoston #thanksDC
@JetBlue why would you hire a guy who doesn't care about the safety of children? Not remotely acceptable. http://t.co/lKFh9HYHW8

@AmericanAir can't get thru to anyone on phone
@SouthwestAir Therefore, since I've received no recourse through phone I have submitted an email complaint &amp; a letter via mail will follow.
@united I will give you one thing, you are consistent but unfortunately you are consistent at not doing your job well #AlwaysDelayedOnUnited
@USAirways Flight 4210 been sitting @Bradley_Airport gate 27 for 10 min w door open since we arrived. Still no jet bridge. Can someone help?
@united Yes. Luckily I was there.

@SouthwestAir kids on a mission trip from Lasalle stranded in orlando area,  they can't get back to Bos or PVD till WEDNESDAY?

@USAirways congrats on treating your customers the worst way possible. I know plenty of other ppl who have had horrible experience w you too
@SouthwestAir the new logo is going to look amazing on the airplanes

@JetBlue you don't remember our date Monday night back to NYC? #heartbroken
@USAirways forgetting to fuel up? Realizing there was more cargo to add to plane? One way to try and mask a delay.
@SouthwestAir Working on a piece about military discounts and am hearing you offer one. Can you give me specifics and confirm? Thank You!
@AmericanAir @_emmaclifford No. At JFK you sort of have to guess things out. It's a small airport, so whatever.
@JetBlue offers hot tea and coffee...at the gate! You guys make me wonder why I have ever flown any other airlines! ‚òï‚úàüëç
@united this is very disappointing. This is about customer service.
@united your unhelpful team? Sure I did. I'm in Bangkok, my bag in Chicago. Are u going to pay for my accommodation s until my bag arrives??
@JetBlue U say our safety is our highest priority but that doesn't extend 2 our property? This is totally nuts. http://t.co/xZY7pHKFGR

@united Hi, Im flying SFO-LAX-SAL-CLO. My connecting time in LAX is 1h45m. Is it enough time? Do I have to collect my bag and recheck on AV?
@AmericanAir - how long does it take to get credit to my AA account? Traveled in Jan &amp; only one leg reported. Asked for credit, no response.
@AmericanAir car accident on my way to the airport. Missed flight from rno to dca. Trying to resched but your line has 2 hr wait
@SouthwestAir nvm, gate said they're holding connections. Thanks for quick response!
@united although, I am stranded in Chicago O'Hare for another 8 hours. Any chance your cracker-jack service team could provide a meal?
@USAirways @traveloneworld .. Utterly frustrated after 4 hours on hold call was disconnected. I need to amend a Flight Booking Problems. HELP! OW Emerald

@SouthwestAir thank you for great customer service. Trying to make it to San Antonio and your staff and alerts have been helpful. Boo ice!
@SouthwestAir traditionally used sledge hammer - low $ taking share from driving | now scalpel approach through data science  #ANAmarketers
@united  4 reFlight Booking Problemss in last 2 days and each time united wait time was &lt;5 seconds! Kudos to you for excellent customer service!
@AmericanAir I know.  After an hour I got a live person.  It messes up our arrival and car plans at two airports and is costing us more.
@JetBlue is JFK still closed? Tryna get out of Ft Lauderdale on flight 502, just want to get home to nyc!
@united what's a good number to call to speak with someone about how you can fix what you did to 50 people and their luggage on Saturday?
@united, no, your service here pretty much ruined my day, but thanks for the weak attempt
@JetBlue Thanks!
@united Step 1: Cancelled Flight flight. Step 2: Don't notify customer. Step 3: Charge them for food while they try to survive their wait. Brilliant.
@USAirways One of your workers was very rude with us. We can tell you in DM cuz it won't be any good publicity...
@SouthwestAir thx - fingers crossed they are found.
@USAirways well then that is a horrible flaw in your system. 2 hours in the past day I've wasted. I've got a job &amp; family this is crazy
@AmericanAir how have you not loaded our luggage on the plane and were OVER an hour delayed? #Flight293
@united Flight 1547 CMH to ORD just arrived at gate. Next segment to YVR already boarding. Will they hold it?
@USAirways The airline is embarrassing itself. I get that bad weather isn't your fault, but your response to it couldn't have been worse.
@AmericanAir What's the status at DFW? Ticket agent at gate A9 was very rude and unhelpful.
@united unless it's on you guys, im good.

@VirginAmerica my luggage is gone. I've filed my paperwork, promised a call/email. Still no resolution or response from central luggage.
@USAirways over 2 hours and 14 minutes on hold and counting. Thanks for the help! #customerservice #brutal http://t.co/VsKXyAmnom
@SouthwestAir I "heart" Southwest but those commercials aimed to satisfy a nano-smattering of travelers to few destinations.
@united how is it that my flight #3367 can arrive early and be delayed due to no gate being available. We are now 20 min Late Flight on tarmac
@AmericanAir Thanks guys got some sleep. Hang in there DFW with bad weather.
@JetBlue walked from the gate to the just ask desk by gate 1 http://t.co/p6ucbVlv5E

@united yo, you need a new website really badly. This day and age...
@AmericanAir I've tried ten times now last night and this morning...how many times should I try? Have meetings to make tonight in ATX.
@united also didn't ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs.
@SouthwestAir What's happened to your customer service? 2 Cancelled Flightled flights in 2 days &amp; an uninformed and unapologetic staff. #nolove #cali
@SouthwestAir I do need help Cancelled Flighting my flight back. Your calls times are ridiculous.
@united Missing flight attendant = Delayed Flight. Prime example how 1 person impacts 100's of people. HNL -&gt; IAH (UA252) #wastedtime
@AmericanAir Hahaha.... "Meanwhile in Russia...."
@united That's correct‚ÄîI've spent hours trying to book online only to receive an error when clicking final purchase button. (1/2)
@AmericanAir narrowly made standby...lots of snags this trip!
@united Your baggage tracking system is worthless! It tells me nothing about where the bag is, much less what your plans are to get it to me
@SouthwestAir I would love to go to the Atlanta show ‚ô•Ô∏è
@SouthwestAir Do you know the reason flight #336 from Dallas to Midland was diverted to Lubbock? Was suppose to be direct to Midland.
@AmericanAir v nice of you to give me a breakfast voucher for $7 in an airport. That almost got me a whole drink!!
@AmericanAir unacceptable. It's clear losing just one customer doesn't matter to American but how many more bankruptcies will it take
@united Adding reservation to iOS app doesn't show up on desktop site when logged in. And miles can't be redeemed for upgrades thru your app
@united @staralliance good.  Maybe that will make up for losing my medallion.  #ProbablyNot
@JetBlue needs to get its act together in #PHX
@AmericanAir what response? Is our flight out of Montrose Cancelled Flightled or not?
@united Hello we are doing a world record attempt on the amount of ball point pens in a collection please could you help with a pen?
@SouthwestAir Beautiful, thanks a ton!
@SouthwestAir planning a family trip to Orlando in May and trying to figure out when to book to get the best rate. Any Suggestions?
@United the ones who suffer. I understand delays, I don't understand trying speed up a process that has been delays to this extent.
@JetBlue I am less concerned about the delay than I am about not being notified until I looked at the board that my flight was delayed
@SouthwestAir I know one thing @Delta would NEVER treat their customers like this!!!!
@USAirways @AmericanAir working for me. Tight cx @Mia so they're delaying our flight. Twice. In 20 secs @jabevan221 http://t.co/G3Uy6w28QH
@VirginAmerica a lot of "apologies" being thrown out to customers from what I can see.Very sad. Thanks for nothing. Worst airline ever.
@united that guy really has no customer service clue.Could have spent effort clearing bins for rollerboards instead of art projects in mine!
@AmericanAir here we go again #aa106 "Plane not ready". Are we going to find the crew run out of time again like last night #shortstaffed
@AmericanAir Thank you
@JetBlue would a storage container like this green one be acceptable to check in with luggage? 18Gal totes http://t.co/mJtK2SFuhG

@USAirways give us no information and an attitude.
@USAirways will you be issuing a travel advisory for CLT for Thursday?  A significant snow storm is in the way Wednesday night.
@united you can't say the flight is pulled in and departs in 2 mins if boarding hasn't even started! http://t.co/2IKbP8gxWi
@AmericanAir it's been almost 3 days and it's still frozen. Thanks doll üòòüòë

@USAirways I have LITERALLY been on hold since 3am est.PlatinumEventually hung up &amp; again back on hold. Understand weather, but ridiculous.

@JetBlue just called that number and left message. Are you at to pass along message to team too?
@SouthwestAir unable to book travel right now on the website or through the app. Help!
@JetBlue why haven't you allowed for flight changes into the NY area airports tonight?  Everyone is saying travel is treacherous.
@united I think I left my phone on my flight. Help!
@united I missed my connection already. Then I missed the next flight they put me on.  Now I'm going to LAX instead of Hawaii.  :(
@united 50 minute wait...still at the gate with a broken jetway. Might miss connection
@united has been such a disappointment today. Simply put. Rather unpleased with things currently. Flight delayed; cant wait to just get home
@AmericanAir we have been sitting on the plane for over an hour. unacceptable. you have a complete disregard for customer service.
@AmericanAir @travisamex It's not the weather. It's also gross incompetence. Understaffing. Crew forgetting to load bags. Don't duck truth.
@JetBlue thanks bae
@united I already sent feedback and your reps are who told me about the priority. I'm speechless at your system
@SouthwestAir /I really love your customer service Lou Ann in Phx rocks. Thanks SW. #be Ourguest

@AmericanAir stranded for 24 hours in MIA, Patrick casimir has been the ONLY AA staff to apologize for the great inconvenience #unreal
@USAirways surely there are some other ways to help me - I can't really afford another 4 hours now. Pls follow me so we can DM
@AmericanAir got back eventually! Was a rollercoaster. Once I got to the airport &amp; got to speak to someone things got fixed very quick.
@SouthwestAir I will never choose @USAirways over you again! #getmeoffthisbird
@united I'll make sure he's done that. Thanks for the help. This is a huge race for him and just trying to make sure it goes smoothly. Peace

@united It's taken ~3 weeks for Cust Care to respond to Case #8477733, requesting a refund for wi-fi not working. Where can I get an update?
@JetBlue so I'm penalized for packing lightly, having 1 bag and paying extra for a seat?
@VirginAmerica when are you flying to hawaii
@united that would be great - 1k us651621
@SouthwestAir : This is the second time in a row I haven't received text updates about flight time change. Don't offer if you won't use it
@USAirways -not just this trip, been a few. Ur saving grace is ur cheaper flights. Now willing to pay more 4 bttr service on bttr airlines.
@SouthwestAir I had to switch airlines and eat the difference (which was not insubstantial) and Cancelled Flight all plans for sat &amp; sun :(
@SouthwestAir I dunno my travel information.. like what?
@USAirways flights &amp; "customer relations" are extremely disappointing. Faced too many problems to type. apology=$25 towards a flight. A JOKE
@SouthwestAir really enjoying sitting at BWI with the door wide open and the a/c on as they fix a "baggage error" #sarcasm
@AmericanAir still waiting for a flight... I should get my money back
@AmericanAir I am trying to switch my flight to AA 1359 I am currently on AA 2401 at 6:50am MONDAY morn then AA 2586! Help Me!!

@JetBlue what happened to our plane meant to leave @ 830? Why do we have to wait for 1 from buffalo? Seems organizational error not weather.
@united EWR TO MCO made unplanned landing because of pressurization failure. Worst pain I've EVER felt, I thought I was going to pass out
@AmericanAir In car gng to DFW. Pulled over 1hr ago - very icy roads. On-hold with AA since 1hr. Can't reach arpt for AA2450. Wat 2 do?
@AmericanAir Only fluctuated because aa took 2 hrs to call me back.Ended up paying (extra) in $US so above statement not true
@JetBlue Very disappointed with the lack of compassion from your baggage services dept. I nearly had to beg get just for a "courtesy report"
@united Your staff, both on deck and in the cabin on UA768 SFO -&gt; BOS were exceptional today. Please tell them well done :)
@united--excited to barrel through the sky at 600mph on a 75 ton piece of metal operated by a company that can't get their tiny TVs to work!
@AmericanAir we've already made other arrangements ourselves.
@JetBlue Why did you interupt the Staduim Series on @NHLonNBCSports. I dont need to see your stupid commercials or Emergency. Info.
@SouthwestAir to the rescue. Sundown in Chicago. Next stop San Antonio! http://t.co/rQBpmwETtq
@AmericanAir an hour now waiting on the phone for US Air help. 10 hours waiting at the airport yesterday. Love the service guys.
@united More concerned that you close a club I paid alot for at 10.  Last flight 11:15p.  The construction going on is very inconvenient.
@united why don't you ever print my known #traveler number on my ticket? Because of this I never get to use the #TSA prescreen I paid for
@AmericanAir Thanks!
@SouthwestAir almost an hour on hold for swa is inexcusable #hiremorepeople
@AmericanAir Is my friends flight 386 from JAX to DFW Cancelled Flighted?
@VirginAmerica  Flight Booking Problems last second flight for next week from SFO- to SAN any chance you want to gift me a promo code since I love you guys
@united UA1023 sitting on Tarmac at ORD when there are visibly gates open. Reassign our gate.
@SouthwestAir my flight was Cancelled Flighted for tomorrow and hold times are long can I Cancelled Flight a leg with you?
@USAirways Hey! I booked a flight (Isabelle Gramp, Boston to LAX), and it said that it charged my credit card but the transaction didn't go
@USAirways 6 hours, no agent. Should I keep waiting?
@USAirways one question. Can I book one way tickets with award travel/points
@SouthwestAir please help on hold forever to check in for flight
@united it was delivered! Thank you for making sure it arrived at my doorstep!
@AmericanAir WORST SERVICE EVER!! Delayed flights for more than 5 hours plus you missed my bag! And your employees are rude üò°üò°
@USAirways I know some folks have to use your airlines but doesn't customer service ever matter? I really hate to complain but it's brutal!
@USAirways I'm not a frequent flyer with US airways, I'm qantas? Can I still get notifications? Thank you
@AmericanAir I sent you a DM, can you please help.
@united, more lies... http://t.co/BEqoTLNugc
@united terminal at MIA should have food open before 5am esp when there are flights at 6am. Two hours early like recommended. Can't eat.
@usairways - It's all automated and no one cares to understand the problem I'm having
@united nope.  no case id either time.
@usairways is there not a faster way to get me to Columbia Sc than making me stay in CLT over night after my delayed flight?
@AmericanAir I'd like to apologize to the gate agent for flight AA76, I was not aware that zone 1 was after the nine other precious gems.
@SouthwestAir I just wanted Southwest to know that I don't think they're as great as I used to anymore. Nothing to look into.
@USAirways still ignoring my question. #USAirways consistently providing poor customer service.
@AmericanAir wasn't just a delay. Your counter wouldn't take a valid CAC card as a valid ID which is needed for a TSA precheck on pass
@USAirways JUST LANDED flight 545. Any chance of making flight 5530 Phoenix to AUS
@AmericanAir ok thank you!
@USAirways I didn't take my original flight. I was suppose to arrive last night than by 2:00pm today. Didn't get in til 5
@AmericanAir can u help rebook passenger via Twitter/DM.  Been on hold for 1.5 hours. Thanks!
@united Late Flight to Denver, Late Flight to Newark...let's not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. Unacceptable.
@JetBlue you reimbursed everyone on the flight a portion of their ticket. I still love JetBlue! Best American airline!
@AmericanAir worst airline! You Cancelled Flight our flight and don't even let us know even though we are traveling with children.
@AmericanAir Tired of sitting on a delayed #1702 again and again computer down
@USAirways we flew out, through and into good weather. when we landed,  another technical issue with gate. improve service or lose customers
@united an inconvenience is a weather delay. Your pilot deciding to waste enough time so the FAA wouldn't let him fly is negligence.
@AmericanAir I'll try to have a great week once I receive it üò©üò≠üíî
@AmericanAir My boyfriend was supposed to be home Saturday but his flight from DC was Cancelled Flightled yet again. Please get him home!
@USAirways We're back at a gate. Opposite of wheels up. Im sure we'll get thete eventually. So thanks.
@JetBlue I thought the same thing after I sent it
@JetBlue I'm flying your airline just out of #LGA üò∑
@united I will, as soon as I am done with my article.  Thanks!  ~Tom
@United - Ridiculous to fly outdated 757s anywhere much less btwn IAH and SFO. No power ports, no  Wifi, no personal entertainment. TORTURE
@JetBlue here you go... Your napkins pretty much say it all! http://t.co/OxY1Jnpjm3
@USAirways @acnewsguy can you give me a # for US Air in philly to talk to a real person? Acarl4@hotmail.com
@SouthwestAir Since when did it become ok for a passenger to save 3 rows of seats for people with a Late Flightr boarding position?how rude!
@JetBlue What happened w/#19 from BOS-SAN? My mother is onboard &amp; the crew was evasive as to why they had to return to BOS the first time.
@united just texted me to say flight is delayed due to air traffic control. BS! They pulled the plane in Late Flight #lies
@VirginAmerica Thanks! Good times there and back! #Vodkatonics the entire flightüç∏#sfo
@united Airlines is changing #mileageplus program March 1 http://t.co/4ojE523PTw
@JetBlue I want to give a warm thanks to your crew at Logan airport for still getting me to the DC area after Cancelled Flightlations this morning!
@AmericanAir at 5 am and have no clue if we have a place to stay or not
@VirginAmerica to battle @SouthwestAir on @DallasLoveField-@AUStinAirport route http://t.co/6RLz0EBk2X via @usatoday
@united and I was denied an upgrade because of catering issues??? #poorservice
@united WHERE IS MY FUCKING BAG?!?! Where the fuck is my fucking bag??? TELL ME NOW OR GIVE ME A NUMBER TO CALL A HUMAN. SAN68059M
@JetBlue If there's a schedule change on my tix, can you change the the destination airport to a sister airport (like EWR and JFK)?
@AmericanAir @derekc21 , I leave Jaipur tomorrow , back to Dehli , Only in Delhi  one night .  we need to  use our abilities to make magic .
@AmericanAir another generic response guys? Cmon. You're terrible. How about an actual helpful person? Not all the rude employees at LAX
@VirginAmerica Boo for a not refunding a seat upgrade fee I did not want to buy in the first place!
@USAirways @AmericanAir Your staff members are looking at me like I have two heads. Check your own websites!!! http://t.co/8Hh0c63TIe
@united exactly it states a secure document is a nexus card. It does not state a passport must always be also presented. Read it
@USAirways Been tweeting with the team at @AmericanAir who informed me that the problem is that you never sent his bags to them yesterday.
@SouthwestAir FINALLY!  A Passbook option for the SWA App. Thank you!!!!!
@USAirways Good info, but am already signed up for all options.  None of which sound like they applied to the 'missing' emails.
@united no, I had to leave for work. Would have not been possible. So I would love to have this replaced now
@united Friend at O'Hare and can't get on flight bc they say no proof he bought 1st class tkt. He has boarding pass.
@SouthwestAir @ LAX is almost a mess. For some reason the express bag drop is slower than the full service line. http://t.co/ORY89eEGek
@VirginAmerica LAX to EWR - Middle seat on a red eye. Such a noob maneuver. #sendambien #andchexmix
@USAirways why would a flight arrive Late Flight or leave when 60% of your passengers have  a connection?
@united Am I illiterate or is there a magic code to make your customer service site work? http://t.co/t4gcKs2bh5
@JetBlue You respond to complaints about cultural appropriation with more of it!?  You're  now below Spirit Airlines on my fly list.
@JetBlue absolutely. The missed connection caused us to miss our ferry to Vieques. Get us to Vieques. Also, flight vouchers. #PRBound
@JetBlue every time I look at the flight status, 30 more minutes is added to the delay. How about some points for trouble??
@AmericanAir @USAirways "but I take meds that make me severely dehydrated" {sigh}
@SouthwestAir has the absolute worst customer service when trying to reach them by phone.
@SouthwestAir Any plans to implement a call-back system on your reFlight Booking Problems line? Been on hold for over an hour now...
@USAirways How can I speak to a human? Need 2 find bag delayed 2/21. Website and 800 # are telling me 2 different things! Got hung up on 2x
@united Never had a flight delayed an hour due to an unbalanced load. And more delays at @flyLAXairport. Great job idiots.
@SouthwestAir Any chance the flight I just took can count for #3? I mean, I signed up with SW wifi in the air! 2/2
@united please fire the captain of flight 6232 today. He single handedly ruined every passengers day by being a piece of shit. #unitedsucks
@JetBlue still sitting in plane in Newburg. This is getting #ridiculous. No way to treat #loyal customers.
@SouthwestAir @DeltaPoints hey at least you guys are honest with your customers unlike @Delta
@USAirways I just want to be heard and to discuss the many issues on my trip
@AmericanAir make sure u insure your luggage as those assholes @ AA take no fricken responsibility...&amp; don't  believe their lies!!!!
@JetBlue - Definitely no note from whoever stole from me.
@AmericanAir Funny you should say that. I have been monitoring since January 1st. No change in availability. #fakeawards #LUVisbetter
@USAirways @AmericanAir  Also your on-hold message is trying to sell Valentines Day gifts.  Over a week Late Flight.  Sounds about right for USAir
@USAirways please give Tara G a pat on the back and praise.  She was very very helpful.  She is at PHL member lounge
@JetBlue I would fly to Washington  DC to see the actual Constitution  and the Declaration of Independence, in honor of a US Navy friend.
@AmericanAir is that something the crew on the current leg can request of the gate team on the next leg?
@AmericanAir please get it together and find my husbands luggage! You're ruining his ski trip to Aspen! 3rd day no luggage.
@united you advertise the flight and its still on you website and still can't be book. spent over 2 hours with united support
@JetBlue nope. The "regular" line was multi-x faster. You literally direct all the wheelchairs and strollers into the same line as EMS.
@united please don't take my membership away :(
@JetBlue Offering Special Fares to @GoPureGrenada @discovergrenada http://t.co/MBcEhCSZX3 @CaribbeJan @islandexpert http://t.co/2Zm4jkAlZl
@AmericanAir this delayed bag was for my friend Lisa Pafe. She got her bag after 3 days in Costa Rica. Issue no updates on your system.
@AmericanAir #flight293 was supposed to depart at 745 and at 815 we still have not boarded.
@USAirways that is actually not true! You can get a seat online after a big hassle. That policy is totally dishonest and misleading. #FAA
@JetBlue to offer service from Daytona Beach to New York - Albany Business Review http://t.co/dUhBJ41jHx
@SouthwestAir where is the great customer service I have come to know/expect; you LUV dropped by EB check in and no help in sight!
@AmericanAir got a callback at 1 am, took care of it. thanks.
@AmericanAir most disgusting chicken entree I've ever seen.  Your standards have seriously nosedived. #NewAmerican http://t.co/56eSsfOOwt
@united a rapid trip plane ticket from Idaho to California that doesn't have problems would be wonderful
@USAirways when AA gate supervisor 600117 was asked for his superiors name, response received was "the CEO of #AmericanAirlines" #merger
@AmericanAir for tomorrow some sites show flight 1642 from ewr Cancelled Flightled, is it?
@united that's not even an apology
@USAirways here's to sitting on hold for 4 hrs flight Cancelled Flighted and they disconnect twice. #fend4urself #stranded #diverted
@AmericanAir I'm not sure what happened to my USAirways status when the merger took place.
@americanair Plz bring more agents up to DFW AA Cstmr srvc ctr gates A, there are only 2 agents and 100+ ppl... http://t.co/uCvEU2hurZ

@SouthwestAir I ‚ù§Ô∏è you! The only airline that understands us military families and our unpredictable changes. Pound it üëä
@SouthwestAir live in Atlanta but cant enroll in your Atlanta companion promotion. Error every time. Can you help? Also sent email. Thanks!
@USAirways so how about some help with suggested time I could call to avoid such long wait time
@united just confirmed a seat! Crisis averted! Beers won't be missed now
@united that's why I blame your company. Because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons
.@USAirways thanks!
@USAirways we're all standing here and no one is saying anything. I'll most likely be missing my flight to BWI AGAIN. http://t.co/JhaU4K48yv
@AmericanAir 4th flight rebooked to is NOT Cancelled Flighted! Woo-hoo. Going to make it to @LaGuardiaAir
@JetBlue says the person who hasn't been delayed for hours and now sitting on a runway with a wailing baby ;)
@united what do you think missing meetings is worth?  A flight voucher?  I fly all the time, so what would make it right?
@JetBlue I don't believe so. That's not what the team has told us.
@JetBlue Why was flight 669 forced to return to NY when there was a malfunction? Why not land in the countless air strips surrounding Chi?
@USAirways Seriously doubt that as I am still sitting inside at the gate.
@JetBlue the you above all commercials? Like the legroom one
@united @JMS2802 : sure show a video of your outsourced favorite TIMCO, who has a knack for doing substandard maintenance work on aircraft.
@SouthwestAir telling my Fam in Vegas now. :)
@united Miserable trip ... lost bag Sat... found Mon... lost again... shipping 2nd day ground Tues... might have it for return flight home
@VirginAmerica @ladygaga @carrieunderwood After last night #tribute #SoundOfMusic #Oscars2015 @ladygaga! I think @carrieunderwood agree
STOP @JetBlue
@SouthwestAir Love Southwest. You guys have been good to me! http://t.co/X4tDY84dBH
@united @dfpietra THAT'S your response?  Shaking my head back and forth with a tsk. You can do better-from customer service to your apology
@AmericanAir I hope you like the photo :) http://t.co/p7fSLuxEGW

@united  gate agent at EWR " if you are disabled or in a wheel chair, it's time to board, please step". STEP UP??? Lol
@AmericanAir my flight number is 3M 50
@SouthwestAir sure can! Just a second.
@JetBlue hey JetBlue.  Still waiting to hear where you lost my 9'8" surfboard between JFK and BQN airports.
@USAirways Is $99 companion ticket benefit of Premier World MasterCard still limited to USAirways flights or do AA now qualify as well?
@VirginAmerica Hi! Just wanted to see if you have any new routes planned this year for Newark. Love flying you guys and hope to do so more!
@AmericanAir thanks to AA / DART for getting me home in time for work this morning DEN-DFW... didn't have to waste a vaca day @dartmedia
@SouthwestAir  traveling 2bwi nMaryland 2morrw any chance the flight being Cancelled Flightled to inclement weather? Any chance can get earlier flight
@JetBlue Has D.C. Thinking About Summer With New Nantucket Service - Broadway World http://t.co/dS22ceeEnj
@SouthwestAir  how many others didn't know you are stopping non stop flights to ATL and from to Hartford Ct as of April ?
@united ouch not fair
@AmericanAir that's 16+ extra hours of travel time. Missed vacation time and now you guys are messing with my professional life.
@united caught earlier flight to ORD. Gate checked bag, and you've lost it at O'Hare. original flight lands in 20minutes. #frustrating!
@AmericanAir I would like to be reimbursed for my shuttle from Denver after #1080 diversion 6+ hours sitting in plane and mech problems
‚Äú@united:That's not something we like to hear. Hopefully our staff can resolve &amp; have you on your way ASAP. ^ML‚Äù:3:15 &amp; still not resolved
@JetBlue Well, thankfully they've got a nice food court here...When will an update be posted?
@USAirways made it to the Bahamas for work but my luggage didn't. I know #travel happens but is there anyway I can get more help/info?
@JetBlue 117 days maybe.
@SouthwestAir flight 1613 Cancelled Flightled??? My wife is stuck in Phoenix on the way from slc to sanThanks a lot southwest!
@united Will never fly with you again! Terrible service!! Ruined our entire vacation!! #lostsuitcase #noreimbursement
@AmericanAir why is it from June 1 thru December 31 there are no bus/first milesaaver awards available from cun to nyc? #Explain #whyfly
@united  Stressed and rude agents. Overwhelmed by delyd flight LAS-DEN 1657. Yelling at several people. Not pretty. This is #friendlyskies??
@AmericanAir you need to have a look at your handling of flight 106 and 104. Company of yours size should have protocols in place to help
@VirginAmerica Anytime, sugafly.
@VirginAmerica Keep up the great work :)
@JetBlue If seats aren't guaranteed why do we pay for them? when I called the rep said some other people booked our seats.
@USAirways already spent 60 mins today handling this for my minor child. Shame on you for treating a 15 year old girl like this.
@united can you please stop Cancelled Flightling your flights? I am trying to get home to take two exams tomorrow. You've Cancelled Flightled 3 flights on me.
@SouthwestAir here we go again. Delayed in Chicago why offer the 630 flight if you never intend to fly it
@USAirways Travelling from pwm to atl on Sunday That flight got Cancelled Flightled and my new flight is Cancelled Flightled and got disconnected when reFlight Booking Problems
@SouthwestAir needs to train their employees to be at lease somewhat empathetic when THEY lose our luggage.  Monika at MWA needs a PR lesson
‚Äú@AmericanAir: @TilleyMonsta George, that doesn't look good. Please follow this link to start the refund process: http://t.co/4gr39s91Dl‚ÄùüòÇ
@united Definitely will!
@USAirways F623 DEN:PHX. Serious display of poor customer service exhibited by flight crew today.   #newamericanairline #cheapslogannotmotto

@JetBlue JFK T5 north check in. 3 bag drop ladies, 1 has been checking in someone for the entire time; another doing check ins too.
@JetBlue word thanks
@united you have failed so uncontrollably today that it's beyond repair. I'm beyond livid with your absolute disregard to operations.
@AmericanAir THANK YOU FOR ALL THE HELP!  :P You guys are the best.  #americanairlines #americanair
@AmericanAir I DMed you my AA &amp; phone #s &amp; you can't have someone call me? What was the point of your response? You didn't resolve anything!
@USAirways Hi! On my dividend miles account I accidentally listed my newly married name as opposed to my legal name. I am trying to book
@USAirways keeps dropping my call and won't even let me stay on hold because they are "too busy" #idontwanttocallback
@AmericanAir your online site doesn't have flights listed in chronological order, resulting in a mis-purchase. Anything that can be done?
@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flight both flights yesterday and rebook me in middle seat. Not acceptable. Upgrade to emergency row would help. #nothappy
@VirginAmerica Done, but I need the receipt ASAP. Could you please help? #150219-000114
@SouthwestAir good to know NOW!  Three sets of travelers in just 20 mins standing here waiting for mins to pass by.
@united you're the reason this whole travel experience has been a nightmare
@JetBlue on flight 2416 to Orlando...ridiculous that we had to wait for this high school band to board. #notbabysitters #whrsthecoach?
@united I'm glad you didn't mean to, but it doesn't excuse your inefficiency! Only took 70min for the bags, we were your only arrival flight
@AmericanAir Oh they seem  to have reappeared now lol
@united on plane to Newark now. I was checked in as Rebecca Levi. My bag is under her name too.
@AmericanAir why are customer svc reps unable to handle calls. Is there a 24hrs Cancelled Flightlation policy? Booked yesterday need to Cancelled Flight
@JetBlue unfortunately no, but hoping I can catch one sometime in the near future!
@SouthwestAir What's with the pricing cache?! About to book a flight, refreshed the page, &amp; the price jumped from $73 to $159. Ridiculous. üòë
@AmericanAir @americanairlines #BQONPA flight #1641 delayed from POS-MIA, missed #2214 MIA- ATL need seat on last flight to ATL.
@USAirways turns into @AmericanAir with such difficulty to past loyal customer. As a AA platinum flyer usair couldn't be more unhelpful. Why
@usairways I've been on hold for over an hour only b/c my CC miles aren't showing up. What a mediocre combo of cc &amp; airline #SwitchingBoth
@SouthwestAir went to front restroom on plane, on sink sign that said no water, use hand sanitizer. First time I've ever seen that. GROSS!
@united I'm fully aware, it's just that your rules are harsh toward the client. Especially since you're going to resell my seat for more $.
@usairways I am sure you are sincere in your apology, its disappointing from a customer perspective when you want loyal customers #options
@AmericanAir offered me a cot to sleep on?After they Cancelled Flightled my flight. A fucking cot. What about a hotel, like you're supposed to provide
@USAirways Shavon at customer service desk in Charlotte was fantastic! So helpful and smiling evn after what sounds like long day.Reward her
@JetBlue Rats, that's a bummer!
@AmericanAir I just DMed you
@SouthwestAir   Thanks
@USAirways - done :)
@AmericanAir thank you!
@united kept me watching the safety video for the first time in forever. Nice job üëç.
@USAirways Was told it was a software bug. Told to call back this AM  Now your system is too busy to handle any calls this AM.  Clown shoes.
@USAirways She spoke with someone this AM and was told that breast pumps aren't medical equipment and that she should have "planned better."
@united @danahajek : she means to say there has been so many complaints today (this week, this month) that she can't respond b/c she's alone
@AmericanAir origin/destination/dates are the same. Going from US Airways connecting flight to AA direct flight. Award is saver level.
@united stop picking on us #CLE http://t.co/VTqE8m1L3i
@AmericanAir followed!  Sure hope you can help!
.@SouthwestAir  I finally hung up after 2 hours and was not able to get the flight I needed. #stuckintampa üòû
@USAirways I want to not sit on a plane from DCA to LGA for an hour and a half which is longer than my flight.
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flight my flight saying it is cause of weather condition when it was the only flight that was Cancelled Flight
@united Will do, cheers
@SouthwestAir due to an apparent water issue that checked out fine during the checks my husband and I already had to deal with our first
@united I appreciate the follow up.
@USAirways Another twist in the plot. Took off from Miami, then had to return due to a unsecured cargo door. most stressful vacation ever.
@USAirways your airline also delayed our bags to us for 4 hours &amp; refused to ship them to our local airport #disappointed #stillbagless
@USAirways thanks!  Can you help remind the agents it's ok?  Ps. Heard rumors of a streaming wifi TV/movie service you might be installing
@united that's brilliant Thankyou so much. Is it classed as part of carryon?
@JetBlue yup! He said there would be flight change fee. But the plane should be here in 45 minutes apparently.
@SouthwestAir you're killing me!! always #delayed from #SanDiego to #SF!! #ugh
@united dm these nuts
‚Äú@SouthwestAir: @pancho_joe No, no, you must've heard us wrong. Sweet mixtape,though" 4 the record,I didn't leave the 80's, the 80's left me
@USAirways Hi, can you attach my AA FF# 94LXA62 to reservation E2KVM4. Thansk!
@united UA7985 is a coshared flight w/ ANA. Unable to check in 24 hrs prior.
@AmericanAir flight 1041 is the first flight.
@SouthwestAir thank you kindly.
@AmericanAir I'm sure all these birds will be in warmer weather soon.
@USAirways nope, done. Was supposed to get home at 9pm and didn't get home until midnight. #NeverAgain
@JetBlue u suck!we have been sitting here for 9hrs because of ur negligence
@USAirways and when will one of these agents be available to speak?
@JetBlue I understand but wish you would have announced the delay 2 hours earlier vs sitting for 2 hrs at MCO
@USAirways what's the point of email stating I didn't get bumped to 1st class? I know I'm not in first class, I booked the regular ticket
@USAirways on hold 2.5 hrs trying to reschedule our flight. Can anyone there please help us?
@united What is your phone number. I can't find who to call about a flight reservation.
@AmericanAir Shout-out to all the ground crews working in the cold! Thanks for what y'all do. (&amp; social media team for customer service)
@AmericanAir no. Booked seat in Dallas, live in Dallas. Real nice that your gate agent had exit row available told me they weren't available
@USAirways @noltnancy What will be is a what may be...what is...sucks. #fail
@SouthwestAir we are trying to go as far away from King'sCollegeLondon as possible for charity today. Would you help us ? #jailbreak #RAG
@USAirways WORST customer service ever!!!
@usairways on hold for TWO HOURS now, pick up the PHONEEEEE
@united CMH gate staff a disaster..#3345 overbooked, no volunteers, no boarding, 20 min Late Flight trying to figure out issue #bringbackrealstaff
@AmericanAir that's absolutely horrible customer service. The person supposed to call me can't immediately call back when disconnected???
@united any way you can help me find a flight to LAS? Stuck in DIA, sat on plane 2 hrs, now been waiting an hour for an update.
@AmericanAir I shared my experience several times (AA Ref#1-2990176298), but AA's response is senseless, weather was not the cause!!!
@USAirways our flight was rebooked with you and we want to change our seats or upgrade to 1st class. Can you help? Phones are down.
@AmericanAir my travel for tomorrow was Cancelled Flightled and then stupidly rebooked for tomorrow! I can't get through to reservations!
@USAirways @jtrexsocial 5 hours on hold ... Safe to say no one is working .
@VirginAmerica sounds like fun !
@united My guess:flight is going to be Cancelled Flightled because there are 16 empty seats and those who confirmed are not important. #frustrated
@SouthwestAir trying to change my reservation, been on hold for 45 minutes, and can't do it online-was directed to call. Help?
@AmericanAir our flight was Cancelled Flightled and rebooked to United. You didn't give them accurate ticket number now we can't check in. #annoyed
@United rescheduled my return flight from #Japan?  Uh why?  Trying to call #UnitedAirlines #customerservice - 45 min wait.  #fun
@united perhaps you could fix this? https://t.co/72RMpkOGwu and this https://t.co/901HLNgBtX #answerthis
@united never fails to have delayed flights üò°
@JetBlue False - agent let us do an extra leg room upgrade for $ but not upgrade to mint. Poor business practices. #badcustomerservice
@united another week has passed and I hoped that I would have had a response by now
@JetBlue Flight is 100% full.
@united on a flight at 11:30 tomorrow.
@united not anymore.  Finally was ticketed 5 min before takeoff.  Not sure why the confusion with a full-fare GSA ticket.
@USAirways Hello we are doing a world record attempt on the amount of ball point pens in a collection please could you help with a pen?

@AmericanAir There was no one from #AA at the #woase2015 event @HelsinkiAirportLots of info available of #winterops
@united 1hr delay at the start, huge queues at security, no representative to meet us, rude staff at baggage reclaim  #inefficient
@JetBlue "Do what you love and you'll never work a day in your life." üòä
@SouthwestAir how about when there are Cancelled Flightlations you just have a link to rebook like you did for initial storm issues?
@JetBlue I knew the 3-4 hours sounded odd; missed a flight we hit JFK an hour early for and your gate  attendant told us 3-4 :(
@SouthwestAir Adding RR number to a @Marriott stay is too hard. Won't take RR number at checkin/out and Marriott phone CS not helpful.
@SouthwestAir I have never been mor e disappointed in a company, charging $8 to use your wifi which only works for about 8 apps parhetic
@AmericanAir I ended up emailing my #Complaint to customer.relations@aa.com, hope that works. #TravelProblems
@USAirways announced that people going to FL via Charlotte would have to go to a different plane &amp; gate, but it was a 'direct flight' #logic
@united you better hold my flight to Tucson #5237, just landed in Houston after an hour delay for some minor computer problem

@USAirways printer problems causing us to sit on the runway for 45 mins. Get it together.
@united @danahajek : United's CEO has decided to outsource and or push out more and more of their skilled and loyal employees..lack of staff
@united Elizabeth at Washington Dulles just hooked me up with a new connecting flight at my gate! I'm super pleased!
@USAirways just hit 4hrs.  what is typical wait time right now? should i drive 2h30m to the airport service desk?
@USAirways yes.  Every one of these on every flight is like this.  There needs to be more Velcro or something
@united Broken entertainment system on my 8 hour NYC flight, terrible cabin crew service and online complaint form won't work #hopeless

@united New Apple cr√¢pe, amazing! Live from UA1207. Really nice crew too.  #AmericanAir has biscuits, UA needs them 2 http://t.co/gZ9GqDT7Jj
@united why would they make me share a room?
@SouthwestAir, been on hold for an over an hour now - when can we expect some customer service? #disappointed
@VirginAmerica to start 5xweekly #A319 flights from to #Dallas @DallasLoveField #Austin on 28APR #avgeek
@JetBlue thanks for making my vacation not worth it again... Currently waiting on the runway for another hour to DEPLANE
@JetBlue I'm over that honestly just would like to get going on the journey.
@SouthwestAir Been on hold over 90 minutes. You can fly, but not answer the phone?
@united unfortunately still on the Tarmac at @fly2ohare and definitely missing my ride from @flypdx #GonnaBeALongNight
@JetBlue This could be the beginning of a BLUEtiful relationship :) #lifeneedsfrosting
@SouthwestAir @Imaginedragons any info on #DestinationDragons ?? me &amp; @sammi_jon3s need to know..
@united lost 4 loyal customers and mileage plus card holders. We could have driven to Florida from Pa quicker both ways! Worst trip ever!
@USAirways thanks for crappy hotel with no food and a taxi bill followed by being on standby for your Cancelled Flightlation. #USAirways
@united ok. Can I DM you the info?
can you not? RT @JetBlue Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/413GiAL0yl
@SouthwestAir @TifffyHuang I met my twitter friend waiting outside the Troubadour #DestinationDragons http://t.co/lf69waf5ad
@united my plane sounds like  a DJ  scratching is this normal? If so, will this eventually be a new entertainment fee.
@united pls follow for DM.
@SouthwestAir heyo! What is causing flight 1836 ewr to hou to be delayed?

@usairways Trying to go Nashville to London and just have no idea when would be a good time to fly out of Nashville right now. @AmericanAir
@AmericanAir yep, they moved me to 16A as they showed me flying "standby"
@united UA 746. Pacific Rim and Date Night cut out. Not constantly or randomly, but one spot, repeatably.
@USAirways 5534. That's the flight I was placed on after original flight to Charlotte was Cancelled Flightled.  Now 5534 is on 1hr delay
@united  I understand that but why should I pay to change if it was a problem with your plane. If it was weather I would understand
@AmericanAir thanks  you always be my airline of choice when possible
@USAirways any tips on getting a hotel that your airline won't get for any of us even though we were told that we'd make our flight?

@SouthwestAir you guys are so amazing for sending people to meet Imagine Dragons #DestinationDragons üòã
@SouthwestAir big thanks to your team. family emerg, same day ticket, experience was excellent. 1st time flying with yall, not my last!
@united poor showing today, no assistance to passengers who mis connected due to maintenance and waiting for baggage
@JetBlue I did.... Would be nice to see more services out of @triflight instead of having to drive 3-4 hrs to like charlotte or atlanta
@VirginAmerica of course! I work for @VirginAtlantic and I'm obsessed with the entire Virgin family!!
@United flight 4465 almost half an hour at the Tarmac "waiting for papers"... Cannot miss my connection at IAH !
@SouthwestAir I'm ready for #MayweatherPacquiao in Vegas May 2nd! http://t.co/8dQZlrJo9p
@united appreciate it, but changing time by 10 min multiple times 6 hours before flight is just annoying and seems like you have 0 clue
@JetBlue Challenge accepted. First 5 crew members to send pics in the chairs get FREE tickets to visit us. #wager #IsItSummerYet
@USAirways @AmericanAir First Class all the way!!üí∫‚úàÔ∏è Headed to @portlandjetport http://t.co/kDMq0jps02
@united also forgot add our bag is probably going to just sit in New Jersey because of a missed connection.
@USAirways in a few weeks
@USAirways was rebooked but sucked big time. Crappy layover. Customer service very sub-par.
üëçüëç‚úàÔ∏è‚úàÔ∏èüíó When are you guys going to start flying to Paris? @VirginAmerica: @LizaUtter You're welcome.‚Äù

@AmericanAir I need refund.
@SouthwestAir TY for your consideration!
@SouthwestAir: why no charging station in SAN?
@USAirways Thank you. But it is sad that she couldn't talk 2 a REAL person &amp; kept getting disconnected by an automated msg.
@JetBlue I have been on phone with rep for over 30 min and was transferred after asking not to be. She was the worse rep I ever had

@JetBlue what is the deal with flt 460 today? Departure keeps changing. When is it going why is it so Late Flight?
@SouthwestAir Your hold music needs 2 be fixed:certain tracks have loud phone button mashing tones in them.Estimated wait time would help 2.
@SouthwestAir So the upcoming RR changes/Deval is trying to tell me not to fly southwest anymore because i am loyal so far. i get it.
@USAirways this is a complete waste of my day. A trip to my for work has now turned into sitting on your planes all day. Ridiculous
@USAirways some people in line have been waiting 55 minutes for a customer service representative
@united if you're going to Cancelled Flight flights today, do everyone a favor and get on it now. Don't stall the inevitable.
@united @FlyANA_official pleasantly surprised to find ANA has made major upgrades on their transpacific route in flights, planes and service
@AmericanAir I just checked the app and it said my flight had been moved back a day? No explanations why. No answer on the 800 number.
@united yea, a refund. Your airline ruined our trip.
@USAirways I find it funny that @PHLAirport responds but you don't. Your customer service is the worst. #wedontcarebecauseyoupaidalready
5 hour delay = shortly?‚Äú@SouthwestAir: @brendanpshannon Brendan, we are so sorry to keep you waiting. We'll have you in the air shortly!^RS‚Äù
@united You can't control turbulence, but you can control customer experience, lot of scared people up here.
@AmericanAir hey I got a call saying our flight was rescheduled but I can't get through to anyone to see if you're providing a hotel for the
@SouthwestAir absolutely required? Are the flights going to be 100% Cancelled Flighted?
@USAirways hour 4 at the gate.
@AmericanAir I have the app - after my nonsense flight Cancelled Flightation yesterday I wasn't able to use the app or kiosk today. Hour long line.
@SouthwestAir thanks for the info and the quick response!
@united I'm counting on you, please don't let me down! #delayed #again #needtocatchmynextflight #alreadyrebookedonce
@AmericanAir I have filed multiple complaints. I prefer to continue warning the public instead of wasting more time with this inhumane corp.
@USAirways- can you tell me what the policy is for preboarding with small children? Is that still a thing?
@VirginAmerica New marketing song? https://t.co/F2LFULCbQ7 let us know what you think?

@SouthwestAir huge problem with someone whose ticket was Cancelled Flighted mid trip. Can you DM?
@AmericanAir thank you for the confirmation.
@united rushed through the -6 degree weather to get to the airport on time. Too bad the pilots didn't do the same. #stillwaiting.
@USAirways YOU ARE AMAZING!!! YOU ARE THE BEST!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE üôèüôèüôèüò¢üò¢üò¢üôèüôèüôè
@united - handed a slip of paper,&amp;said to call 1800#. Have called 2x/day trying to get it sent, still @ layover airport.Have that ref # tho.
@united Apart from being on hold for over 2 hours and having talked to 5 people and the problem still not resolved!
@AmericanAir in miami and the  agents Rachel Wong and Marisol Pimentel were very  pleasant in a world of chaos a BIG .thank u
@united I think problem resolution should be decided on your end. Especially if you'd like me to continue flying your airline.
@USAirways we can't afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home, turns out we can't afford to go home.
As soon as I can, sending my son home with you Saturday. @JetBlue
@USAirways, I know you're dealing with the weather, but @PHLAirport is a hot mess. Pls send reinforcements
@SouthwestAir  thanks Southwest for saving our trip. my sweetheart isn't going to miss seeing #AltonBrownLive thanks to y'all! #SOhappy
@JetBlue @Leopolds_IC  No but my friend in the picture - Phillip Heller (JFK IFC) did and he said it was delicious!
@JetBlue I appreciate the quick response but how can no one go outside to check temp so we can leave in BUF #currentlysittingontarmac
See you in ATL! ‚Äú@SouthwestAir: Congrats to our #DestinationDragons winners! Ready, Atlanta? http://t.co/AY1GIdcfa4 http://t.co/yC7V2s0iOd‚Äù
@united this team added 30 mins on turnaround
@USAirways Fuck you
@usairways My flight was Cancelled Flighted Saturday. Why was my luggage not at the airport? Today, I'm supposed to have it delivered. Pathetic
@JetBlue loves Cancelled Flightling tickets and not telling their customers #flyunited
@USAirways i will be Cancelled Flighting my us airways credit card and choosing other airlines after my experience this week.
@JetBlue I know where you guys jet! LOL, but if you love me so much, help a brother out :) Hot weather, great nightlife, 2-3 hour flight
@united KOA-LAX should have fresh food service, right?
@AmericanAir yes I did but no response.
@JetBlue your app needs updating. Says my flight is on time when we are well past boarding time with 2hr delay http://t.co/BTvpxTZJu0
@SouthwestAir why are the ticketing lines in Las Vegas so unorganized??  Mass craziness. Half of the ticketing stations unmanned.
@AmericanAir Understood. Thanks anyway
@USAirways plz plz plz hold 4438 to EYW. The 810 PHL &gt;CLT is sooo Late Flight. Gonna miss the connection for @jabevan221 's 40th #GTH239
@USAirways husband tried to use dividends &amp; companion fair for emergency, transferred &amp; put on hold for over two hours gave up #disappointed
@USAirways thank you for blowing my vacation. Couldn't get me anywhere today to make my reservation and also lost 2 bags of mine!
@united #unitedairlines so my feedback is for your benefit, not for you to correct your atrocious customer service? Good to know
@united can someone please explain the process of of what happens to property found on a plane after passengers leave at Heathrow ?
@USAirways hey let flight 1874get to the gate  hours Late Flight and no fate with dozens of kids on board
@USAirways 42 minutes holding. Seriously, if your average wait time is over 30 minutes then maybe, just maybe, you're understaffed.
@AmericanAir Would love to DM you, but my Twitter app says you're not following me and I can't.
@AmericanAir lost my cats, missed their flights, kept them crated 30 hrs for a  would-be 5 hr trip. You'll never touch my pets again.
@SouthwestAir Hey yea I got thru...everything is good now (well, in 7-10 days when the voucher goes through)  Appreciate it!
@USAirways Will you pick up your phone then?
@AmericanAir Thanks, have emailed them. How long should I expect for a response?
@JetBlue using A321 JFK-SEA for Summer 2015. It will be my first A321 flight ever! No Mint to Seattle, Core Config only.
@SouthwestAir suggestion- shades on the windows @KCIAirport so travelers won't have to watch ur luggage handlers throwing their bags around
@JetBlue yes, well they are operating outside of your terminal and targeting vulnerable passengers. No better than thieves.
@united God damn fucking crew won't be here till 6:40, so you've known for over an hour and a half the flight time was bullshit.
@AmericanAir Thank you! You will see me :)
@united yes still need assistance I don't have a flight home due to change in flight u made I miss all connections !
@JetBlue Sure did go south after breakfast though! Delayed three hours. :( :( :(
@SouthwestAir thank you!!! #bringbacktheluvtordu #miami #directflights
@AmericanAir #worstcustservice you should have contingency plans for extra workers during bad weather. 4+ hours hold #ridiculous
@SouthwestAir Hi! Just wanted to see if you have any new routes planned this year for Newark. Love flying you guys and hope to do so more!
@united Really....you charge me $25 to check a bag and then you put it on a different flight....still Don't have my bag!!!
@SouthwestAir had to rebook through Atlanta &amp; now drive to #Nashville. Had to pay ridiculous price difference. Bad weather good for business
@SouthwestAir thank u for not leaving me @me nice job running thru the airport to catch your connecting flight
@united 30 hours Late Flightr still no answers stuck in Houston. Keep getting put on phantom flights that never apeared. #BadCustomerService
@united...lies lies lies....still sitting at the gate, have not moved an inch http://t.co/LulGnwEfFH
@SouthwestAir Sort of, but I'm arriving a day Late Flight and have to incur overnight costs in a connecting city. Not cool at all...
@united too big to properly manage flight times. There is such a thing as being on time. Or at least prepared with a gate when we land!
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/RkwugmanM9‚Äù lmao you know a white person said this
@USAirways nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay for Choice
@AmericanAir Err 2 hour wait time for the Exec. Plat. line?
.@united For those playing along at home: http://t.co/2b4bDTldX2
Lol great answer.. ‚Äú@AmericanAir: @JayFranceschi Our agents are checking in passengers as quickly as possible. We appreciate your patience.‚Äù
@USAirways with the weather mess in the South, I missed my connection in CLT. Impressed though with the Cust Serv phone reps today.
@JetBlue's CEO battles to appease passengers and Wall Street - Waterbury Republican American http://t.co/5t4FpCGREJ
@USAirways why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period? Unacceptable.
@united it's disgusting and unconscionable the treatment I've received tonight.
@SouthwestAir when are the two free flights promo coming back?! Looking into the premiere card but might hold off or go with another option!
@JetBlue pilot: "Don't worry folks there's a backup for the backup for every part of this plane." Thanks guy
@USAirways I made it- thx.
@SouthwestAir Any way you can help with entry to Vegas event? My Boyfriend &amp; I have been @Imaginedragons fans since 2009. They are awesome!

@AmericanAir Heard back at 7:30 am today, was put on flight tomorrow AM, arriving home at 4 pm. Meaning I'd have to take a 2nd day off work.
@united following
@JetBlue All good, I just have 2 remind myself that if this was 1914 I might be on a horse &amp; buggy. So what's a little delay right.
@VirginAmerica yes, nearly every time I fly VX this ‚Äúear worm‚Äù won‚Äôt go away :)
@USAirways [Part 2 of 2] she tried calling cust serv and the system hung up and her. Twice. Are you having system issues? Please advise.
@SouthwestAir @CallMeStanley7 And bring back the "Agent will call you back..." feature. Why was that ever discontinued???
@JetBlue My bag is missing from 1099 landed over 6 hours ago. Help!
@SouthwestAir do you have any flights from NAS-BWI ton March 23?
@AmericanAir Thanks for the champagne  AA153 ORD-NRT to celebrate my #TokyoMarathon2015 finish! http://t.co/Ij4xL01tKX
@USAirways I found a flight I want on @CheapOair. Is my @AmericanAir AA Advantage # applicable to earn miles on it since you're merging?
@AmericanAir $90 dollar RT ticket to Chicago? Yes, Please!

@VirginAmerica our flight into lga was Cancelled Flighted. We're stuck in Dallas. I called to reschedule, told I could get a flight for today...(1/2)
@USAirways IS THIS RINGLING BROTHERS BARNUM AND BAILEY???  SHOULD I KEEP MY EYES PEELED FOR THE CLOWN CAR???
@USAirways @hhagerty that's a lie.
@USAirways trying 2 fly frm DCA to SRQ to visit a family member in hospice but 4532 was Cancelled Flightled, can someone assist me?
@SouthwestAir only 1 guest needs to change a flight on a reservation of 2. How can I do it? I NEED this to happen. Say it can...Please help!
@SouthwestAir u texted that my flight from Denver to SD tmrw is Cancelled Flightled? Been on hold for an hour trying to get help. Any other flights?
@United never heard of this? http://t.co/QDebyaHqfM
@AmericanAir Cool, a canned response. Nah, I think I'll keep tweeting at everyone who mentions AA on Twitter. You could DM me, though.
@united it most certainly was not.
@AmericanAir followed. I tried to @USAirways record locator number, gave me an error code
@united why no preferred security line anymore. My TSA pre-check didn't pull on my @SilverAirways partner flight! #Platinum #spoiled
@USAirways I'm assisting @marccopely. He is already rebooked. Agents rude, unhelpful, discourteous. #FrequentFlyers appalled. Unacceptable!!
@united you guys suck!
@SouthwestAir tv stream means I get to spend my flight watching 1999 and 2011 Women's World Cup Finals. #throwback #bestflightever
@SouthwestAir ugh kicking myself for missing out on #destinationdragons. I need some @Imaginedragons back in my life  http://t.co/sbEhi46bMk
@USAirways And how do you only have 1 agent at PHX customer service desk when an hour ago the line was over 100 people long?
@SouthwestAir I have a credit that expires a month before my flight, is there any possible way I can have that extended?
@AmericanAir 8 hours on the phone yesterday.  Really?  Still doesn't pick up status on US Air flight.
@AmericanAir absolutely worse cust. Svc ever experienced in 25 yrs of flying.  Supvrs at iah extremely rude. #poorservice #travel
@USAirways Pilot pleads to let boarding begin for full flight #1937 while waiting for 4th flight attendant. Denied by mission control. Grrrr
@SouthwestAir I was on hold for 30 minutes &amp; no one knows how to win these tickets that you're still handing out? #DestinationDragons
@VirginAmerica morning. If I have a question regarding elevate points &amp; flights can I DM you?
@USAirways I did not want to hang out on your plane all day when I am traveling to get work done and turn right back around. Unacceptable
@united follow back and I'll give you the details.
@SouthwestAir Are there any current promotions/codes for Nashville-Denver? Thank you!
@AmericanAir can you tell me why flight 1542 from dfw to phl was Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow?
@SouthwestAir my birthday is during #DestinationDragons and im a huge fan- anyway I can get tickets?
@united @baldordash Rebooked,arrived 8 hours Late Flightr.  Last year 9 hrs to San Diego and the no inflight entertainment!
@AmericanAir your message was delayed I just responded
@JetBlue there were seats but after waiting on hold for 20 minutes they were gone-now she has to stay another night in charleston-very pricy
@JetBlue thanks for the update. 'Preciate it. Hope it gets here. Been delayed 2 days getting back
@JetBlue Washington DC (:
@VirginAmerica amazing to me that we can't get any cold air from the vents. #VX358 #noair #worstflightever #roasted #SFOtoBOS
@JetBlue thanks. Line moved quick. Already done.
@united @staralliance the B gates are very far though
@AmericanAir @dfwairport  Have been trying to get canx flight resched since noon.  got 2 call backs but call disconnects as soon as I answer
@USAirways is probably losing a family of world travelers as customers due to broken processes. @AmericanAir I hope you can fix it
@AmericanAir fair enough. But they could have at least told us. Once again it's the lack of communication. Delays happen, just tell me
@AmericanAir bad weather happens but lack of preparation is inexcusable. Depending on good weather is not a good business model.
@United of urgency, but this is ridiculous. Your ceo claims to be customer focused, yet when delays happen, planes sit and customers are
@JetBlue What's your excuse this time for 1117 delay from LGA to TPA? I know the plane is in the air.
@SouthwestAir When will your phone agents be able to give the correct departure times for CUN? When can we checkin online for international?
Hey @united why does the flight from IAH to POS leave so Late Flight, and the one back to IAH so early? I rather get to POS earlier
@AmericanAir ; @USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Unprofessional, unprepared, unsympathetic, lacked communication, and lacked solutions.
@USAirways I‚Äôll do that in addition to reviewing on my blog. Your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than :/
@USAirways I can't even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive, forcing me to purchase a new ticket.
@SouthwestAir good to know. Perhaps it was execution then.
@united why is my flight from mke to ord getting delayed? Our gate attendant is not communicating!
@USAirways 1899. Thanks
@USAirways I can't wait to never fly with you again. Always delayed. Always lose my bag. Rudest people on the planet. Southwest is the best
@SouthwestAir I will.make sure to tell everyone I know about this all around horrible experience. I will also post it on my business page.
@VirginAmerica I luv ur people and product! 1 thing is y do u charge for herbal tea but not black tea? I'm not a caffeine drinker
@JetBlue Thank you for the free flyfi!! Makes an already great airline even better! #jetblue #Boston #westpalmbeach #flybetter
@SouthwestAir it's too damn cold to be sitting on this runway with no heat!!!!!
@USAirways sits on a throne of lies
@USAirways Look at that. The flight I have been trying to book for 3 days is gone. I guess someone got through. Thanks! Keep up the #Failing
@SouthwestAir Why do you have to be 18 üò≠
@AmericanAir Was not on board you today just watched report unfold on Twitter but still am very proud!
@united - you delayed our departure by 2 hrs to wait for passengers from another flight that was Late Flight! Unacceptable!!
Is rudeness and poor customers service a job requirement at @AmericanAir ? Been waiting 28hrs and still haven't even seen one planeüò°
@united please upload the March on-demand entertainment listing on your website! ‚úàÔ∏è
@USAirways should give me free baggage for this mess
@AmericanAir Thank you
@united bags arrived - I sure miss the customer focused days when I used to fly @ContinentalAir1 Here's hoping @united wakes up
@SouthwestAir looks like my 1 yr anni trip has been replaced w someone's itinerary. Worried abt who can c my flight http://t.co/BApE6RuMNE
@USAirways worst service at Reagan Int. I rarely post about a company or service, but I am so annoyed. Not weather reLate Flightd‚Ä¶incompetence.
@SouthwestAir not terribly inspired to call "customer service" in the future now.
@JetBlue's CEO battles to appease passengers and Wall Street - Waterbury Republican American http://t.co/FFc13zYGJS
@AmericanAir there is a fat man stuck in your airplanes bathroom
@united When will direct flights from Belfast Intl to Newark resume from their winter break? Thanks.
@AmericanAir 4285. Apparently we‚Äôre told, staff on the ground keep promising to come and they don‚Äôt.
@United how do you lose a gate checked bag DEN to ORD? Direct flight. Ugh.
@united clicked "upgrade now" and it didn't upgrade. What gives? http://t.co/N7oSjz8a59
@SouthwestAir Thank you. The email about RR pts &amp; how to gain more wasn't clear so all of mine r gone. Anything u can do is appreciated.
@united How do you have a scheduled flight WITH NO CREW? Is there a competent person working at this airline?
@SouthwestAir especially if it's your mom! #IChangedYourDiaper
@AmericanAir I wasn't important this morning when you would not seat my wife and I together or allow me to choose seats at Flight Booking Problems!!
@AmericanAir As I already have a booked flight that I can't use &amp; can't change w/o a $200 fee, Flight Booking Problems a different type of ticket...1/2
@USAirways 3+ hours on hold... oh, wait, for less than 5 minutes a useless CSR talked to me and put me back on hold for the last 30 minutes.
@united This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?
@AmericanAir wht n üëé experience w/aa reservations #service Tried to be patient with rep and she just disconnects me aa do u record conv.?
@SouthwestAir Although the wait was long due to weather r/scheduling, a phone call and super rep solved the issue! Thank you!!
@USAirways Is it possible to earn Dividend Miles for a passenger that is not me, even if I am purchasing the tickets?
@VirginAmerica You should still develop an app - then you will be my favorite airline.
@united Great landing in Denver, next Rapid City. Snow starting to fall...Florida Everglades is a faint sunburn away...here comes the cold!
@united delayed because of salt on the floor from previous passengers? The 180 of just just want to fly, don't care about our shoes. Ua649
@AmericanAir will you review your systems re notification? The website and telephone systems you have in place are clearly inadequate.
@USAirways I called twice the recording says that it has being delivered to my apt but it is not here ?
@SouthwestAir please please please http://t.co/xiJiFYmvqP
@JetBlue haha thanks Jetblueüëå‚ò∫Ô∏è
Thank U üòò ‚Äú@JetBlue: @ItsLaLoca But of course! Safety is always 1st!  We'll make sure to handle her with CARE and LOVE!  :)‚Äù
@united I received 1 bag last night, I am still missing the other one.
Just got off the phone @AmericanAir customer service. Only 8 minutes to get my issue resoled. You guys are awesome.
@USAirways thank you!
@JetBlue a little vino wouldn't hurt üç∑
@AmericanAir been calling 2 different offices already and still no sign of my baggage. First time on American Air.. (6)
@AmericanAir continues to win: I've never missed a flight before, but a nice little quiet gate change made it possible. Sheesh.
@united crew has been notified, passenger moved but water not fixed. Now on tarmac two hours
Why we can't have nice things. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/HP9RPPCvHx
@AmericanAir Thanks for the reply, but a functioning plane four hours ago was the only way to do that. The staff was friendly, tho.
@AmericanAir why Cancelled Flight #1605 on 6/25 &amp; 6/28? Flights now 4 hrs longer &amp;  have layovers. Too Late Flight to find a reasonably priced alternative.
@AmericanAir I get &amp; can appreciate that. I've just had so many problems in the last year flying with guys... Pretty aggravating.
@JetBlue Finally taking off! LAS-FLL-SJU #letsgo
‚Äú@JetBlue: @KyleComer_ JetBlue reLate Flightd this time? ;)‚Äù no... But why won't school be Cancelled Flighted? it's very cold out
@united I'm rebooked on a flight tomorrow even though I had 1st class seat orig I have a lousy coach seat
@united 2 days and 3 planes with mechanical issues?  Now over 1.5 hrs Late Flight sitting on this plane. This is insane!!
@AmericanAir got another flight. Thanks you
@USAirways Wow! Your miles program is Ripoff,Quick ticket fee 75$ I hope you all end up on unemployment.
@AmericanAir @HeyMyNameIsSEAN Sean if you look at the AA schedule it sometimes gives you a clue if new'airplanes are used. They are gr8
@USAirways you have to be crazy! Treated my mom very poorly. Not happy! #usairwaysfail
@SouthwestAir @TheEllenShow @Imaginedragons if only that was me! üòç #DestinationDragons
@USAirways unfortunately not. I think I watched it take off from the bus. Rebooked for a Late Flightr flight now #planestrainsandautomobiles
@AmericanAir you have such a confusing web site/complicated ordering process. This is why I typically fly @SouthwestAir.
@SouthwestAir I'm 30 mins out WAIT FOR MEüò≠üò≠üò≠
@SouthwestAir ruined my Sunday. 3+ hours of delays out of DIA, now my bags are at the wrong airport. $35 to deliver them? Insult to injury.
@SouthwestAir please hire an efficiency consultant to manage your PHX baggage checkin. Way to many open kiosks with 100's of ppl waiting
@JetBlue I don't have enough hands to count the number of times something like this has delayed my flight with you guys. Very disappointed.
@SouthwestAir i forgot to put my tsa pre number in before I checked in. It is now in my profile but will it be on my boarding pass in the am
@SouthwestAir can i get tiks for #DestinationDragons omg id love to! Plz üò±‚ù§Ô∏èim dying
@SouthwestAir tried to rebook online but it says that I have to pay $200 for difference in price. Please help
@AmericanAir Can't help now as all seats have been taken.  There has to be a way to handle high volume of call days.
@united I was sincerely thanking the pilot of flight 4461 of braving the snow and getting me home amongst many other Cancelled Flightlations.
@AmericanAir while I'm sensitive to this fact, I don't believe that warrants poor service. A little help &amp; compassion goes a long way.
@JetBlue ...really?
@united After our unscheduled refueling stop and missing 2 connecting flights we r home n looking 4ward to our bed and a big PB&amp;J sandwich.
@USAirways Batting 1.000! Four flights in a month, all four delayed!
.@JetBlue yes and not boarding at 6:44. Good luck with that. Push wheels up to reality.  Dare you.
@USAirways gonna miss connecting flight.. Delayed flying out of Boston
@united rebooked 24 hours after original flight, to say your handling of situation was bad would be an understatement.
@united @dmb41shows I need this plane to get to buffalo so I can leave tonight. Any progress?
@united 4 passengers after a 2 hour delayed flight left with no hotel at the end of the night @ hou airport. Wtf??!! http://t.co/ZfqMpGXVS6
@united A measly $50 e-certificate is not how you appreciate loyal customers after they wait 3hrs on the tarmac during UA1116. #unacceptable
@USAirways  will be stuck in PHX overnight.  Service is getting worse.  Flying southwest from now on.
@AmericanAir your assistance has not been very helpful frustrating disappointing experience &amp; w/small children very inconvenient
@AmericanAir Additional fare cost $19.. Tix change price 195 UK Pounds ($304). $19 not the issue the 195 UK Pounds IS ! #badcustomerservice
@VirginAmerica I am deeply disappointed that your birthday promo was not applied to a trip I booked mere days before I received the email
@JetBlue Not for the dates or destination I'm headed üòî
@USAirways I wish we were on our way. Now there's a problem w/de-icing.Three &amp; 1/2 hour delay so far &amp; sill not sure if we'll be taking off.
@SouthwestAir it's ok...I forgive you guys.
@united Holiday of a lifetime to New York ruined because you lost my luggage and have failed to find it since Sunday! #wontflyagainwithyou
@USAirways travel agency said that if usairways accept we will refund money i dont understand why dont u refund
@united no they did not want to deliver at my house. Had to go to sombrons else house
@AmericanAir @Rizzilient I booked tickets using miles and need to change the dates.  Have been trying to get to an advantage rep 4 two days
@united Rhonda C. at Atlanta airport redeemed you guys. She got us straightened out.
@USAirways @AmericanAir Any word on accommodations for the passengers on US 746 when they arrive in Charlotte? Lot of tired passengers here
@USAirways no one at #clt knows about runway issues..my inbound flight was only one delayed..connection left without me..now I'm stuck!
@SouthwestAir I never got my flight confirmation. I've been on hold for an hour and I can't get info online. What am I to do?
@AmericanAir cannot talk to any agents keep getting hung up on crazy
@USAirways I promise, if I can help it I will nvr fly w/u again. Even if I have 2 pay more $$$ 2 fly w/ sum1 else #badcustomerservice
@JetBlue Still no response from CEO. I guess he is at the Oscars.  I bet his flight was on time.  #JUSTWRONG
@AmericanAir TY! But, their site says " Please note that we do not offer a print subscription service for American Way. ..."
@AmericanAir can you take care @Cowboycerrone please.  Thanks
@SouthwestAir microsecond too Late Flight so very very sad üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢
@JetBlue heading to Buffalo... trading the cold in Boston for colder in Buffalo... Maybe the Caribbean next time?
@united I take back the comment about your team here working hard to help us A so far no solution for a hotel or food or anything #fail
@USAirways no you not sorry. I am trying 2 add a day 2 my vacation but there is a $200 charge just 2 change flights
@JetBlue im in a session presented by one of your beloved travelers, @paulgordonbrown,I see why you love him so much http://t.co/vv8cFyhKVb
@AmericanAir if business class if full but 1st class empty, do you guys upgrade EXP members to 1st?
@AmericanAir @tcunningham10 please call us back to rebook. 7403607771 we can't through!!!!! We need to get to columbus!!!!
It really is nice, though. The snack fridge‚Ä¶that you can just get up and take stuff out, like a dorm common room, is genius. @JetBlue
@USAirways help im falling out of one of your planes
@AmericanAir No Meelan did not afford a supervisor to be included in the conversation, pls check the rec of the call #badcustomerservice
No they didn't -.- ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/58B7swRpmq‚Äù
@united wasn't trying to Cancelled Flight, just trying to change my award ticket, same date and place, but thanks for sending the link, I know the fee
@AmericanAir I know you can't control weather but you can control how you treat customers..#shafted
@JetBlue thanks. We are ticketed on stand by for flight 1970. I hope we make it out. Fingers crossed
@united is unfriendly screw family, that hates kids and moms. now waiting on  UA871... pray its better FYVRFN ..due to agent error and tickt
@united I tried the online tracking and they said something like "attempting to locate luggage"
@SouthwestAir Had a great trip this past week to Vegas for work; and had this pic over the Southwest on Southwest! http://t.co/a3YCFlaLxV
@SouthwestAir thanks for adding straight flights from Columbus to Oakland!
‚Äú@USAirways: @TMadCLE We don't like to hear this. We're sorry that it's taking so long to get through.‚Äù Stop sending generic responses
@SouthwestAir @Matt_e_Boss how long did you have to hold? We waited 35 minutes and gave up
@AmericanAir I'm frustrated by all of the @USAirways attitude toward #ExecPlat members. #thenewamerican
@united here I was thinking how I could say so many nice things after getting upgraded, but then you delayed my flight... It's ok!
@united obviously the staff at EWR - United or otherwise have not seen your ads about - being FRIENDLY and helpful #ewr worst airport
@SouthwestAir "Airport snow removal method #22.."Keep up the good work folks, this is where Cessna's become 747's! http://t.co/7poFSXOjSY
@united All flights Cancelled Flighted :( Trip refunded without difficulty, staff extremely helpful, no complaints! Way to handle bad weather!
@USAirways yeah I know that but that doesn't get me my money back does it, everytime I fly with you something bad happens.
@SouthwestAir that's awesome! Love flying SWA!
@JetBlue HE is a lap infant (4 mons old)
@united Why do I have to give up my leg room so these 4 people (not in my row) can fill the bin?  Pls start charging. http://t.co/2nY5TuXFqf
@americanair Not surprised that you were the Fastest Responding US Brand on Twitter for Q2 + Q3 2014. Also 10th fastest in the world in Q3
@AmericanAir the worst air experience I have ever had and I am not in the first plane yet.
@SouthwestAir your agents were the ones who were rude and unhelpful and prompted my initial tweet. This is so easy to fix.
@AmericanAir @USAirways I need to Cancelled Flight a flight I booked earlier tonight. Are you able to do it over Twitter?
@VirginAmerica my group got their Cancelled Flightlation fees waived but I can't because my ticket is booked for 2/18? Your reps were no help either üò°
@JetBlue Tx for the info. Just don't understand why you couldn't accurately estimate departure time earlier. Weather in ny is fine now.
@AmericanAir thanks, me too
@USAirways Not only did u lose the flight plan! Now ur flight crew is FAA timed out! Thx for havin us sit on the tarmac for an hr! #Pathetic
@AmericanAir amen!
@united 3 days Late Flightr and my bag has not left IAD, United is not helping at all. Everyone tells me a different story
@USAirways #flight2031 the flight to Hell
@VirginAmerica you have amazing staff &amp; super helpful as I just ran the @WaltDisneyWorld #PrincessHalf they have spoiled me with comfort!!!
@JetBlue on hold for 30 mins placed on hold then hung up on 2nd time in 2 days Only looking for group rates. BOS-SJU 5-12 to 5-19 10 people
@united how do you go fr Silver Elite for two straight years to group 5 all the time?  I get no group 2 but maybe 3 or 4?  What's up?
@USAirways Excited that I'll be flying from Syracuse to interview in Dallas on Friday for the FA position- this is a goal &amp; dream of mine!
@united thanks for the reply. I have been in contact with Customer Care to get clarification on this issue.
@AmericanAir have been waiting over THREE hours to talk to someone to rebook a flight due to weather. does call back service actually work??
@united thanks for ruining my wedding anniversary. Flight UA4904 from EWR to RDU is delayed by over 3 hours and will reach home the nxt day
@united I am trying to find out if the loaner seat is new or used, a used car seat is illegal according to safety regulations
@VirginAmerica what is going on with customer service? Is there anyway to speak to a human asap? Thank you.
@AmericanAir why does your RTW planner (spec. Circle Pacific) not let me even plan the demo routes from your website?
@USAirways btw, not upset at usaiways, promise.
@SouthwestAir @fox8news Serious potential for a wanna get away commercial out of this debacle.  But for real, you should fire @Kristi_Capel
@united the os isn't controlled by me but rather @VerizonWireless .  App is new.
@AmericanAir please rebook me from Seattle to Columbus Tue 2/24, locator: KARAAX, name: Mitchell M Neuer
@JetBlue many thanks, as always your employees are professional and courteous. Whenever I have the option, you are my go-to airlines.
@SouthwestAir oh, ok!  all good!  looking forward to escaping the cold for a bit!  thanks!
@JetBlue I can't find a good photo of it... You got one? #goodnight
@SouthwestAir Is there anyway to pay more to get priority boarding A 1-15?
@AmericanAir follows the Talent PM of #BDSM porn site http://t.co/UQGW6qsFFU. New "Economy Dungeon" class coming? http://t.co/pl9Sop5IHu
@JetBlue Counting on your flight 989 to get to DC!
@USAirways look out for flying rocks this time! It's a bird it's a plane! Nah never mind it's just a rock...
@AmericanAir we made it so no worries... You guys did good tonight and even put @ESPN_CoachMack on my flight #firstclass
@SouthwestAir I have a flight on Sunday the 22nd to Columbus from Denver. I just got a travel alert on my southwest app. Is the rescheduling
@united &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;------- shoddy customer service. Of no use whatsoever. #unitedairline
@USAirways @AmericanAir have been trying to call customer service since 9pm. After an hour, was disconnected. Spoke to no one
@AmericanAir hey there me again from yesterday im still on hold
@AmericanAir why are you still selling tickets when you haven't rebooked people to arrive at their destinations on time?
@SouthwestAir is there anything I can do to get tickets for @Imaginedragons at @VinylVegas? It would mean so much to me #DestinationDragons
@united got it, look forward to hearing from you soon
@USAirways thank you for continuing to be the worst airline out. Didn't need that extra hour of sleep after 29 hours of travel anyway
@united also, the mere fact that I have to go online to issue a statement vice calling and talking to some directly is one good example.
@AmericanAir This doesn't address my issue. I am on hold for 30 min to speak with an agent.
@usairways I purchased a $49 upgrade on a flight 2 weeks ago and you gave it to someone else but I have not received a refund. Is this SOP?
@united thanks, we did.
@SouthwestAir your gate agent re-routed an impossible itinerary and we had to find a new airline to get us home. Super bummed about this
@JetBlue how long does it take for a bag to get to the baggage belt!!!!!#toolong of a wait
@JetBlue no. come on.
@SouthwestAir stewardess really funny! Now I could get the gent next to me to use some headphones, this would be the perfect flight!
@united how do I get my account number if your website says email is unavailable?
@united a big thanks to ^MN and ^KN or patiently clarifying the United domestic world to me.
.@JetBlue Navigating through 2 rebooks due to flu &amp; ice to visit my Mother.  Your CS reps have been so very helpful, patient and friendly.
@AmericanAir thanks for getting back to me. But I will find other airlines in the future.
@AmericanAir this has happens so many times. It's just upsetting to see how poorly an airline treats their customers
@JetBlue You guys need pillows on these rockers to really knock it out of the park ... just sayin ...
@JetBlue no. Please stop.
@SouthwestAir my pts expired. I made a prchase @ an online retailer to b told by SW that those won't show for 6-8 wks so too L8 2 keepmy pts
@united @highbuddyyy that totally sucks my cousin worked at PHL said @united
@united ok, have sent u info via DM. I appreciate your help and consideration. üòä
@JetBlue I now learned that customer service at SXM works for the airport, not JetBlue. They need a supervisor to do anything.
@SouthwestAir I love imagine dragons o flipping much, pls #DestinationDragons
@AmericanAir thanks for getting back to me. But I will find other airlines in the future.
@SouthwestAir will you please start offering services out of @triflight and @AshevilleAir to other airports.. Have to drive 3-4 hrs to use u
@united I'll try it. Mileage programs have historically been a lifeline for us world-hungry travelers of moderate means.
@USAirways would be more pleased if you reassess your business practices.  Goal should be to have passengers on plane as little as possible
@united #CustomerService #fail long time flyer switching airlines #frustrated
@SouthwestAir thanks!!
@SouthwestAir Officially a customer support game of wills... 2hr30 on hold... Who's the loser here? Oh yeah, that's me.
@VirginAmerica twitter team. you guys killed it for rescheduling me asap. thank you!
@JetBlue I have been hanging here for almost an hour
@AmericanAir how do you refuse a customer who is willing to pay to upgrade when half of your first class is empty
@SouthwestAir Open more kiosks at Austin-Bergstrom. Three lanes to service a line of 50 people? Really?
@JetBlue thank you. Is there a possibility it will change?
@USAirways there's over 50 people in line and only one agent!
.@AmericanAir @TyWinter it's really the small things--the details--that make an excellent experience or a really irritating one.
@AmericanAir I tried when I landed, but there was no-one there.  I've emailed your customer service twice now who don't seem to care.
@VirginAmerica I need to register a service dog for a first class ticket from SFO &gt; Dulles. The phone queue is an hour or longer. Pls advise
@SouthwestAir the woman working the counter in philly at 630 this am needs to be fired. Due to bad weather, I along with other passengers
@AmericanAir have been in call cue for 11 hours. No call yet. Wife in cue for 9 hours.  Got a call but was hung up on.
@USAirways @Gregm528 well there is certainly nothing happening "in front" of the scenes. #Noaccountability  #disappointing
@USAirways comin in clutch and sending me to Charlotte then home, I h8 u @AmericanAir, except for Wayne u a real g #ThankJesus #ThankMe
@united @TiffanyAndCo @NTrustOpen ah, so that's where the funds to fix the broken plane upon which I sat for 4 hrs on IAH runway went.
@AmericanAir Your AA3465 staff are refusing to allow a woman to board. She was here at 8 for 8:16 departure. Sign still "Now Boarding"...
@united you should change your name to United Incompetence. No flight until Monday, have to take a 7 hour drive now to get to my flight!
@united currently on board so not now. Check in was terrible. Staff rude. Expensive luggage thrown around etc.
@AmericanAir no, you should do something about everything happened yesterday...
@united why am i mot getting my refund?
@usairways when trying to check-in online, it says to call...now I've been on hold for 2 hours...what to do?
@USAirways by far the worst airline in history. I'll never ever fly your garbage again
@united you told me you changed my flight and im in the ottawa airport and AC cant find my reservation! Whats wrong with you
@united really, fill out a form about my flight experience? I sent an email to the 1K email address.
@SouthwestAir think you have great people working for you.
@SouthwestAir The problem is apologies don't help. Results matter and it's proving impossible to find anyone who is interested in that.
@USAirways phone support rebooked but orig flt was Late Flight. Made it!
@united splitting up my flights quadruples the price
üòê ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/QavvlAXLkl‚Äù
@SouthwestAir now accepting #Apple's Passbook app for boarding passes. App works on #iPhone &amp; #iPodTouch, not #iPad. http://t.co/XxSaomBdGS
@united hoping there is a spare a/c for 1171 tomorrow!  Have a ship to board!  The sched aircraft is delayed from previous flts.
@JetBlue at what point do u Cancelled Flight flights to DCA- other airlines have already Cancelled Flightled
@USAirways on Sunday! Can't wait! See you then
@JetBlue where do I add my AA loyalty number to my Jetblue reservation?
@AmericanAir hey! I have a name issue on my reservation can you help?
X__x RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/xxppZo88j1
@united can you help 689 in Chicago get to a gate. Freezing on a runway seems like a crappy thing to do at 9pm
@united I have a voucher that expires next week, can I get an extension on it before it expires?
@USAirways Can I book award travel on Etihad with Dividend Miles?
@SouthwestAir F5R3ZZ
@united That made me so mad, but then I called the bag number, and that person was helpful and told me where the bag really was. (2/2)
@USAirways -- I've been on hold 40 mins to Cancelled Flight my reservation for this afternoon. Is there another way? Web tells me to call.

.@SouthwestAir you've got a mess here at DTW but your staff is doing great.
@JetBlue yes. They are working on it. Hoping bag is on the next flight and will deliver home...
@usairways I‚Äôm cool with weather delays etc. But lying and deceiving passengers to keep them from changing is reprehensible. #yousuck
@united I can't DM you so here's the confirmation # G8CVWJ - please is there any way I can make it to Kailua tonight? Thank you
@USAirways why does this flight keep getting delayed Late Flightr and Late Flightr?
@JetBlue understood ... but could I go and put myself on the standby list 5 hours prior to my flight?
@JetBlue no, but we're on the flight leaving from Boston to Seattle right now. :) flight 597
@united refund?
@AmericanAir the issue wasn't a long wait. It was an infinite do loop. Your system didn't let me (or any customer) wait or leave a message.
@SouthwestAir LUVed the SJC gate 23 agent this am who boarded flight 372 to DAL. Didn't get his name. He represents your brand so well.
@AmericanAir my flight was Cancelled Flightled from Laguardia to Louisville Ky and i am  stuck at the airport. Do you guys compensate for this?
@USAirways I believe you. But in all seriousness, what's an acceptable time I should have this expense on my name that wasn't my fault....
@AmericanAir @USAirways Statement wasn't sent yesterday like Jeanine said. After I even called last night as well. Again, excellent service
@united this is atrocious customer service.
‚Äú@AmericanAir: @Dawn_Davis You're very welcome, Dawn. We love taking you flying. Let's do it again!‚Äù Again in 1 week!
@VirginAmerica husband and I ordered three drinks via my screen and they never came. Awesome!
@JetBlue is that one on the picture http://t.co/lxwbsfxfj0
@united In 2015, United is "unable" to look up a flight reservation by passenger name at the YYZ check-in counter - WOW smh #customerservice
@united has been showing the same tone deaf video for all these years about how "wifi is coming!" Hah.Not before I leave. @VirginAmerica ftw
@USAirways it's not misjudging it's a deliberate strategy. Seen it multiple times on USAir. Makes staff life easier at expens of passengers
@united - are you aware your airbus fleet sucks?  I'd rather fly a C-130 full of rubber dog shit.
@JetBlue Thanks JB. Actually, As a birder I love them too. They just need to be outside. It shouldn't be too hard to trap and move them.
.@united being delayed 3 hours for a one hour flight is more than frustrating. I'm also unable to get a decent meal at this hour.Never again
@USAirways can I get a beer please. Flight #1715
@united how's my refund coming along??
@united I'm on UA1118 and my direct tv isn't working.  How do I avoid this in future?
@AmericanAir When Flight Booking Problems an int'l flight online, do I have to provide a passport number when Flight Booking Problems or just when I arrive at airport?
@SouthwestAir  the agents werenot helpful told me I would have to pay 2chng even though I Tld them going2 bwi whch is part of trvl advsry
@USAirways flt 5302 CLT to DAY supposed to depart 5:51; the 6:20...still no crew. #schedule/contact the pilot!
@AmericanAir thanks.....
@united Asked Flight attendant what typical compensation would be &amp; says we might get free TV. #Unacceptable
@AmericanAir Trying desperately to rebook my moms flight. Waited 10 hours for callback, got disconnected and they didn‚Äôt call back. #help
@JetBlue  thanks for response! Crew has been VERY patient with us, but they are also frustrated. Wouldn't be so bad but airport is closed!
@JetBlue sorry for my misunderstanding of the term, but what does that exactly mean?
@AmericanAir don't they already know ?  Isn't everyone sharing how nasty the food is? It's not even close to decent.
@VirginAmerica started my flight with a scolding for using an overhead bin that was then offered to the person seated next to me.
@JetBlue disappointed that my flight back to boston from PR was Cancelled Flightled,rebooked 4 the next day,delayed that one too, and no compensation
@AmericanAir you could train your flight attendants to have some manners and decency
@united I've never experienced worst customer service. Placing blame on codeshare partners and not assuming responsibility is unacceptable
@SouthwestAir - 800 is not int'l friendly
@united hold for 30 minutes finally got someone and they retook my form of payment and confirmed that my reservation was set. I tried to

@JetBlue Airways to continue 'various commercial relationships' with #Lufthansa ... - @CAPA_Aviation http://t.co/o5sifHp4RT
@united thanks! We would like an apology and a full refund. Please confirm when we will receive.
@JetBlue what's a good address to send feedback over email?
@VirginAmerica add DTW and I'm sold!
@JetBlue you quite possibly ruined my entire first day in South Florida bc of your disorganization. #GetItTogether
@USAirways the fact that you are making customers pay $15 to "choose" a seat and try to convince them using psychological tricks with colors
@VirginAmerica what is your policy on flying after surgery?  I am still waiting for answer so I can tell me doctor.
@USAirways is there a number to call to modify reservation.  Please help. Very frustrating with american and us air merger
@united How do I get reimbursed for hotel and taxis for the Cancelled Flightation?
@VirginAmerica trying to add my boy Prince to my ressie. SF this Thursday @VirginAmerica from LAX http://t.co/GsB2J3c4gM
@AmericanAir Thanks! Bleh, disconnected! Let's try this again!!
@AmericanAir are you expecting flights out of DFW to be Cancelled Flightled tomorrow AM and afternoon?
@SouthwestAir so was there a winner for #DestinationDragons ???
@SouthwestAir is it possible to add travel arranged by my employer to my upcoming travel? I can retrieve a reservation, but that's it.
@SouthwestAir Twitter says I can't DM someone unless they follow me.  Can @SouthwestAir follows my twitter? thanks you.
@USAirways. On hold 2hrs after my flight was Cancelled Flightled &amp; "Anthony" was beyond rude and not helpful! @AmericanAir they're weighing you down.
@SouthwestAir the 5:50 is sold out too?
@united I have been told twice my issue has been resolved and twice it has not been. And when I write an email it bounces?! #worstservice
@SouthwestAir Katie, Gate C47, Denver International, fantastic customer service helping me and 2 new flyers; thx for amazing staff!
@SouthwestAir can anyone help me upgrade to buisness select !? Cant seem to get hail of the right area at all .. I know you guys are good
@VirginAmerica why Cancelled Flight flights today? No precipitation to be scared of!  ‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è
@JetBlue I'd go to Australia to enjoy the land down under! Always been on my bucket list! #FlyingItForward
@JetBlue Flight 1447 (N351JB) "JBLU" arrives at @FlyTPA following flight from Westchester County Airport http://t.co/xX2M2jxQep
@JetBlue claims w/ customer protection they "will notify customers of delays, Cancelled Flightlations and diversions." #NotTRUE http://t.co/3oq1T4ohjl
@AmericanAir Also, been on hold for 30 minutes with your "customer service" to find out when my new flight is scheduled bc your site SUCKS
@JetBlue now when I call it's still at the warehouse and might be going out tonight
@SouthwestAir safety back in Dallas!
@JetBlue Flight 152 (N559JB) "Here's Looking at Blue Kid" departs @MCO enroute to @BostonLogan http://t.co/qeaDA92MW6
@JetBlue hi. Just DM'd info
@USAirways us2118My wife in Boston says no snow right now.
@SouthwestAir Secondly, we did not begin boarding on time despite our aircraft being present and deplaned. Thus we left over 30 min Late Flight
@united that's wonderful. unfortunately doesn't help on this 4 hr flight between to major U.S. cities. #disappointed
@AmericanAir TY Can you confirm or deny if AA953 left JFK? I want to figure out if more delays are in store. Internet giving different info.
@USAirways customer service failure aside, one would think you guys would care about inaccurate manifests. I'm sure TSA would.
@USAirways Umm, can you define 'extra time'?
@SouthwestAir is service to Aruba being permanently discontinued in August?
@united made me remove 1 pound from my checked bag otherwise they would charge me $200. Loyal flier for 10 years - time for change.
@USAirways It is the 2nd person when I called again to ask, could not catch her name, rejected the request
@USAirways what is the holdup? Should I be looking for another flight?
@USAirways is there a phone number or email address to customer service?
@JetBlue I wish you all the best of luck :-) I'm enjoying the luxurious free!! amount of leg space rn. Thanks
@AmericanAir Telling frustrated customers "we are super busy, please call back Late Flightr kthxbai" and then hanging up is not the best practice.
@SouthwestAir Next once we arrived to Atlanta, we waited a full HOUR before our luggage was placed on a carousel. One hour!
@AmericanAir flight Cancelled Flightled and was trying to reschedule but 800 number just says to call back
@SouthwestAir weather where? And at what time Cancelled Flighted? No I can't because meeting was today.
@USAirways @HutchinsJim Yes, I made the flight and got my workout in too.
@JetBlue flight 2302 from JFK to BUF.
@USAirways owes Tammy from the Winston-Salem call center for keeping me as a customer!
@united How many 787s do you currently operate and what other aircraft do you operate?
@united I sent a message. It's very irresponsible that my suitcase cannot be found. This is truly worst service ever... #fedup #disastrous
@united it's operated by united as it's a heathrow-Newark flight
@AmericanAir thanks üò©. idk if it still Late Flight but I hope I get it tonight üò≠
@united patiently drinking and tweeting about my experience
@VirginAmerica at Logan airport and waiting to checkin for my 9am flight. Checkin desk not open !!!!! Why?!
@USAirways after sitting on the runway for 3 hours i had to leave the airport w/o my luggage. Is this ur 1st day??
.@united board customers onto a plane with no pilot? The only thing that expedited was my time in line to book a new flight. Come on now.
@SouthwestAir pretty terrible customer service. Sat on hold 10 min. Then a busy signal. Then disconnected. Do all airlines have to suck?
@SouthwestAir I was never able to talk so someone so had to buy another new ticket. Will be calling shortly for refund.
@united Flight 1640 (N33289) arrives at @FlyTPA following flight from @iah http://t.co/RvCDA2nnme
@AmericanAir Flight for tomorrow was Cancelled Flightled. New one booked. Seats taken care of. Just a tweet to commend you all on the service. Thanks!
. @united you know your updates every 6 hours telling me you don't know where my bags are is also equally irritating. #ColtsMissingBags
@united please give special thanks to Aaron in Tampa office for helping me for literally two hours! He's amazing. Mission accomplished!
@JetBlue I don't want to seem crazy! Have already asked twice!
@united already Flight Booking Problems next week's trip on @AmericanAir  thanks for making the choice so easy #disunited #unfriendlyskies #servicefail
@USAirways no my flight plans have been delayed until tuesday due to your computer crash
@USAirways only sympathy she offered was holding a reservation until Monday night. That's pretty awesome if you ask me...
@JetBlue there was a closure? People here need to inform passengers, not send them gate to gate w no info on boards re: updated departures
@JetBlue that's not a answer!
@AmericanAir  when do you anticipate decisions for Cancelled Flightlations at DFW tomorrow morning? Need to rearrange hotel reservations, etc. ASAP!
@AmericanAir flight 65 delayed over 4 hours on 2/22, had no GF meals despite my early request, attendant seat fell on my leg #badservice
@USAirways good work by flight 1798 crew.  #Chairman's recognition even in coach.  Too many #missedupgrades Late Flightly.  What's up with this?
@AmericanAir rented van drove 250 miles with 6 strangers.  Arrived home 6:00am. No offers of help from AA. http://t.co/BTTGmyN0A0

@AmericanAir Super Spring Tides and ‚ÄúTide of The Century‚Äù Drawing tourists to French and U.K coasts:http://t.co/gXdqORtsS0
@SouthwestAir is main supporter of play where Jesus is portrayed as homosexual partner of Judas and who performs a ‚Äúgay wedding‚Äù #boycott
@jetblue as courtesy to Mosaic members or anyone, a request for water should be attended promptly. Daniel in flight 1557, should know better
@united does this process ever end? Still waiting for the reply since 2 months #pathetic #customerservice
@united boarding a #plane would be much faster if you boarded back to front instead of front to back #MakesSense #efficiency #travel #flying
@SouthwestAir I tried again with your in-flight wifi #fail
@AmericanAir no other (what should be valid) Circle Pacific itineraries can be booked either - always makes all US dest. invalid 4 last leg
@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flighting flights 45 minutes before takeoff &amp; sitting for 45 min on the runway of the rescheduled flight #badservice
@AmericanAir Your agent sent our family on 3 diff planes to dfw that were as Late Flight due to delay as the Cancelled Flighted plane that started this #fail
@SouthwestAir #DestinationDragons @Imaginedragons I'm a HUGE FAN! I would love tix to your show!
@SouthwestAir @karajusto OK we will! Thank you!!!
@united read the thread. I booked 1st class , now seated at 38E even though United Twtr account confirmed Eco Premium.
@JetBlue should've been on one of your flights instead... @SouthwestAir has now lost our bags to add insult to injury
@JetBlue 2:55 tomorrow from RIC to BOS. Looking good or am I better rescheduling?
@SouthwestAir Yes! How about #DestinationDragons in San Diego?!?

@USAirways website isnt working and I cant talk to any1 on the phone to check flight status out of dfw. Roads are awful and cant get there
@USAirways why no ground crew at DCA when we're already Late Flight arriving #evenLate Flightr
@JetBlue You never got my wife to her destination and you expect a $75.00 "goodwill credit" will  make everything hunky-dory. You blew it.
@USAirways Is there a way to have someone contact me when you have an agent available? Need help Flight Booking Problems an award flight.
@AmericanAir After 3 days NO BAGs amazing the way that you neglect customers
@SouthwestAir How can you get your TSA traveler ID added to your boarding pass? Why would it not be included as TSA precheck? Flying tomorro
@SouthwestAir @AARP @JimCramer 75yo mom says, "Hire more staff to accommodate your audience" You could learn lots from her. She's off to FL
@JetBlue i love this song &lt;3 thanks @JetBlue
@united frankly worse customer service ever. Problems will happen, how you deal defines a company. Never again United.
@united LHR arrival lounge #fail. Waited 20 mins for shower then left to find hotel. U know how many passengers u carry. Planning???
@JetBlue hi! Is it possible to upgrade to a Mint seat on an already booked ticket? Thanks!

@jetblue the man sitting next 2 me at the terminal has a scent tht i cant quite put my finger on. pls dnt let him sit by me on the flight.
@AmericanAir Any reason why my 1463 flight to Chicago is boarding and I still don't have a seat assignment? Seriously?
@VirginAmerica please contact me about portfolio left on flight VX 27 from JFK to SFO tonite seat 7AM. Need it returned. Call 914-329-0185.
@AmericanAir then taxi across dfw airport for 20 min to then state 75 min past departing from gate that we need deiced? Wow. Uncool &amp; untrue
@USAirways already called, no other options, flight is being reimbursed. Never again, you are unreliable for business travelers.
@SouthwestAir I love you guys! Had to take a few other airlines this week...makes me love and appreciate y'all so much more! #onlywaytofly
@AmericanAir LGA already by the time we pulled from the flight. QQBMUG. feel free to look up how many flights we've been "reticketed" on.
@SouthwestAir I wrote to your customer support on Monday re: a Cancelled Flighted flight but haven't heard back. Any idea what's up? Thanks.
@united, any options to cos tonight? Doesn't look like #UA5525 will make it in time for #UA6259. Should I reserve a hotel room?
@SouthwestAir why is your website downnnnn :( ugh
@SouthwestAir having trouble with Wifi. No matter what I get redirected back to getconnected page even though it says I'm connected.
@USAirways That is not an excuse to have such a poor website Flight Booking Problems options! My yearly vacation is about to fall through, ubetter do smth!

@USAirways Just contaced EYEWITNESS NEWS about the ripoff the Cancelled Flighted now they want me to pay
@united I would have made it if you hadn't already booked me on another flight and Cancelled Flighted my original reservation.
@AmericanAir great flight experience again... SFO-JFK... Dare I say it? A consistent high quality on a legacy airline? Keep it up guys!
@united first time flying with United. Also last time. #terrible back to @VirginAtlantic for me. #branson #virginatlantic #UnitedAirlines
@JetBlue I will try that. Thanks! If all else fails I will just do the old fashioned method tomorrow morning.
@SouthwestAir - stuck on the runway, again. Delayed on Wednesday. Not a good way to take care of your loyal customers.
@united thanks for causing us to miss our connection and now a 6hour delay #flydeltanexttime
@JetBlue We just landed in Vegas but not allowed to leave the plane just yet. Thanks for making me miss my flight at 1 pm. #fustrated
@AmericanAir in line at SFO. Customer service is rude, disorganized, and congested. Very dissapointing.
@united direct messages not going through please help
@united I want my bags. There is vital equipment in there. You are royally screwing me. I'm cranky and want an update.
@AmericanAir but my friend was told she was able to use her credit with the airline towards one of my flights, then was told she couldn't.
@usairways &amp; @AmericanAir planes in #grandcayman http://t.co/GX7QbtckBr
@AmericanAir is this how you let your employees treat your loyal customers? #attackingbabymomma #crazinessintherockies
@AmericanAir No! We departed 24 hours Late Flightr, with a crazy crew. One of the lady simply freaked out and got away from job before departure.
@AmericanAir absolutely disappointed in your lack of service. Lost my bag and can't even deliver it after I was told it would happen.
@AmericanAir Yes I am. 2495/1170. RNO departure at 1229 on 2/25 w/connection at DFW to LGA. I can do the 1120am to LAX and then to JFK
Just sent thank u RT @united: @goodenufmother Please DM your confirmation number if reFlight Booking Problems is needed. Thank you. ^EY
@JetBlue im still waiting??? No answer!!
@united ..back for the expensive holiday, he worked all year to pay for, that you RUINED! We want compensation &amp; his original case back!
@united the proper response: sorry for your wait, what flight # were you on so we can look into the issue. That's how @Delta would handle.
@AmericanAir stuck in airplane both on way out of PHL and again in Houston. All passengers frustrated. Makes me want to avoid airline
@AmericanAir Thank you for responding...My laptop is in my bag and I need it for work. I am worried. The file code is UTEVGW.
@JetBlue on your 1503 flight JFK to PR. They got the doors open on this frigid temperature. #icyflight
@SouthwestAir belt issues. Been a rough day for them. Worst part is traveling with 9 month old and having to wait outside in 85 degree
@USAirways offloading the plane?!?!?! This is ridiculous!!!!
@AmericanAir if it I have not rebooked didn't get notified that it was Cancelled Flightled
@SouthwestAir Is there an email address I can send some thoughts to? This experience was really not good &amp; I have some feedback.
@SouthwestAir male flight attendant on flight 3913 from Orlando to Indy was AMAZING! He needs a raise üëç Had the best experience with him
@AmericanAir I have a couple questions for you, if you‚Äôre available for PM?
@SouthwestAir I want one!
@AmericanAir Hey, so... I think I left my wallet on you. Can I have it back, please?
@united #sfo #ClearVision #TV4U @ United Terminal SFO Airport http://t.co/Q9bYn9pCTf
@united a report was filed with the airport police on 11th and 12th February-I have the police case number if required
@united thank you !
@united you have to follow me in order for me to DM...come on now
@SouthwestAir Thank you ^AH. Still wish someone picked up the phone - 3hrs- dead phone. Taking your tweet as a refund confirmation.
@JetBlue what's up with the broken tv in seat 6F on flight 1818 today? Planned to catch the @cavs game!!! Nooooo
@AmericanAir Nope, I have not been rebooked.
@AmericanAir @macario2 but you are Late Flight again!! Again and again! Where are the crew?
@USAirways @Forsyth_Factor hope for no weather delays no help to reroute and your on your own for lodging non stop is the way to go
@VirginAmerica Can I get some help with a support ticket? It's been 15 days.... Incident: 150202-000419 Thank you!
@united @JMS2802 : nothing like supporting your own mechanics and maintenance workers...instead United puts out a video of TIMCO doing wifi.
@AmericanAir Thanks but don't understand why they couldn't have used the tug at the next gate over, ground crew took a break? #unacceptable
@SouthwestAir Hey SWAir- a very tortured boarding on flight 1971 due to one gate agent having to board assisted folks one at a time.
@united I like delays less than you because I'm the one on the plane. Connect me with a voucher
@JetBlue what's going on with 1171 LGA-FLL..poor to no communication from gate agents??
@JetBlue definitely!
@JetBlue  any effort to fix your points system? 11 days and a call to customer service and still no account update. Chasing points is no fun
@SouthwestAir Why can't I find a cheap flight from DC to St Louis? The prices went up like crazy for April weekends!
@AmericanAir complt incompetence on flt 295.Lav delay from a pln that lnded last nite, no internet and poor svc. Not what I expect from u.
@united your announcement for pre boarding only addresses mobility. My disability requires me to travel with a lot of stuff. Do I preboard?
@JetBlue so technically I could drive to JFK now and put in. Request for tomorrow's flight?
@united is by far THE WORST airline I've ever had the misfortune of flying with in all the 44 countries I've flown to!!! It's outrageous!
@united (2/2) pay in person at Portland airport. I will be flying from Perth. This has been done by US Air.
@USAirways @AmericanAir on hold for 8 hours yesterday w/o speaking to an agent on hold again w/ 2 phones ~30 mins let the bashing begin...
@VirginAmerica done! Thank you for the quick response, apparently faster than sitting on hold ;)
@SouthwestAir when will you have flights for October 2015 available?
@VirginAmerica seriously, though. will there not be direct flights from SFO-FLL in may???
@AmericanAir now on 5th plane of the day. First 4 all taken out of svc. Scheduled dep 3 p.m. Still on ground ORD 10:45pm
@JetBlue okay awesome! Thank you!
@united clicked on the link and got this? #confused http://t.co/xMAQcucWZl
@SouthwestAir I can't begin to tell you how slow my plane's wifi is. I can't even pull up an email.  What am i paying $8 for??
@americanair Seattle check-in. 1 desk servicing full service line. 2 desks servicing priority. Full srvc wait 30+ minutes. Customer svc fail
@AmericanAir several hrs Late Flight and 140 characters won't do it. Cheers though
@VirginAmerica I adore you, and am so looking forward to my flight to Austin in two weeks.
@USAirways never in my life have I dealt with such poor customer service, irresponsible staff and lack of care LGA-IAH day 2, baggage in NC?
@SouthwestAir My DM won't go through but it is 261633561838. Please let me know if you need anything else.
@AmericanAir I don't like making a scene but this hasn't been addressed properly. Please have them do that.
@united thank you for the reply. I emailed your customer care department about my experience.
@USAirways ...2 hours on the plane, they at least got us on a direct flight a couple hours Late Flightr on United
@AmericanAir I know. Just a little cold weather humor. :)
@AmericanAir thank you for doing the best you could to get me rebooked. Agent on phone &amp; addtl resolution on DM was very much appreciated.
@SouthwestAir flying flight 3130 tomorrow at 7:20 from PBI- I have boarding position C-42. Is flight overbooked? Have funeral to attend!
@SouthwestAir Thank you for the vouchers after the long wait on the runway Saturday night at BWI! I really appreciate it! #SWfan
.@USAirways It was this saturday during all the snow in the DC area.  Excited the flight was not Cancelled Flightled but sad he went missing.
@JetBlue I may need to. I had a 40 minute layover and now have a 15 min delay on my first flight.
@SouthwestAir @coachGS what's even better is the price changed in the 2 minutes since I talked to the lady and they still honored the cheap1
@USAirways our hold up now is the captain that was Late Flight...his bag doesn't fit.
@USAirways 4473.  She just called to say it's a runway clearing problem of all things.
@JetBlue you are doing a horrible job at JFK...you need to rethink how you put these routes together. Unprofessional
THE END: RT @USAirways: Reminder: From 2/28, we‚Äôll be tweeting from @AmericanAir. You should join us: http://t.co/NBpCJCpEW9
@USAirways Been on hold 2.5 hours now! System hung up on me twice after an hour holding. :(  Trying 2 correct online Flight Booking Problems error. #unhappy
@united @czamkoff It's all about profit, and they don't really give a damn about paying customers!!!! #greed
@USAirways @AmericanAir no, don't leave me!!!
@JetBlue Thanks! Her flight leaves at 2 but she's arriving to the airport early. Wedding is in VT in Sept. Grateful you fly to BTV!! :)
