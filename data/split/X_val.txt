@JetBlue my wife sent me a family invite but I never accepted it. She should not be locked into a family account that never got created.
@united Thx, just DM'd. Conf #'s MQXC64 &amp; MPWNC2. Any help appreciated
@united Making sure your flights aren't delayed due to poor maintenance would be a start.
@united @JMS2802 : outsource it all United Airlines...your customers  are just loving you for it. Outsource. Outsource. Outsource.
@united Hi! what is the phone number for reservations in Venezuela? Thanks
@usairways Row 16, flight 634 today if you're looking for specifics! I can run to Home Depot for the WD40 you if you need.
@AmericanAir No, it wouldn't let me complete transaction because it was one way from Barbados to NYC
@united  UA 1706 there is no way a plane "loses its software" I believe you decided to do an upgrade...
@JetBlue were boarding now I'm really not impressed. I've learnt a very valuable lesson .
@USAirways what is going on with the computers? Why is my flight grounded? Why does your airline suck so much? #UnansweredQuestions
@united can anyone assure me that the aircraft coming to Denver had left it's previous destination? Flight 3618
@united 1st u delay my flight for mechanical failure,then 2 hrs on the runway, &amp; 13 hrs Late Flightr I'm still here with a lost bag &amp; no resolution
@USAirways I've been waiting for the callback for EIGHT HOURS. HOW MUCH LONGER?!
@united Ugh.  My bags were sent to Palm Springs and not to LAX as promised.  They better be at the hotel when I get there.
@SouthwestAir been on hold  for 2 1/2 hrs. Can't get 2 airport 4 flight icy country backroads! Help pls? Can a human answer? #BNA
@USAirways Sadly I'm currently booked on one of your flights tomorrow that I will be changing if I can.
@SouthwestAir doesn't charge ticket change fees. Do they not incur the same mysterious "costs" that you incur, @united?
@united Kewl. Will also let them know the overhead bin over my row was "Inop". I love a good abbreve.
@JetBlue i am sharing it to the public. I fly 20 times a year and sitting now on the tarmac in fll. Your staff is the worst i ever met.
@united Thank you, ^JH, appreciate the prompt responses--me and other passengers will be doing so.
@USAirways how about an update with real information?still waiting on Tarmac in Philadelphia.
@JetBlue expanding!  http://t.co/Kk6EixifP5  #Nantucket #Aviation
@SouthwestAir might be the worst airline ever
@USAirways I’d suggest proper information dissemination to all staff on a more timely &amp; relevant schedule to prevent this in the future.
@USAirways Hey, my bag was damaged flying with you yesterday. What can I do?
@SouthwestAir bags fly free..just not to where you're going.
@AmericanAir 4 phone calls, 2 hrs of being sent back &amp; forth between two lines in the terminal and it's the skycap that finds a solution
@USAirways nah it's for my flight next week.. inside my Chairman 7-day window but you still haven't released the last open First seat to me
@SouthwestAir allows you to change a flight once for no fee, yay! I will always book flights with them. @AmericanAir changes you $200
.@united it will be because I'm moving to @AmericanAir because of @united talk, no service
@SouthwestAir Just realized my Luv Voucher expired today. :( Any chance of getting some luv with an extension? Please? #VeryLoyalCustomer
@united is screwing with my flights again at CAE? Why do you bother having flights here if they never leave on time or get Cancelled Flighted?
@AmericanAir customer service is terrible.Been waiting 6 weeks for a reply to an email. Not helpful at all and keep brushing off problems!
@united On flight 1712 to Houston delayed duecto engine trouble. Willl you hold my connection to Argentina at Houston since I'm Late Flight now?
@USAirways I totally understand the weather. Just frustrated. Thanks!
@USAirways using all of my monthly minute on hold with you assholes
@SouthwestAir they arrived Late Flight but pilots got us to DIA on time. #impressive #outstanding #greatservice #allgood
@united flight 5431
@JetBlue As long as someone remembers to put it on plane right? That was a really lame excuse.Geez @JetBlue can do much better #coffeeneeded
@AmericanAir is there only one call centre? I know it's busy right now, really need to speak to agent not computer
@AmericanAir I know your policy. Just asking for a little kindness due to extenuating circumstances.
@USAirways Made about 30 calls to USAir today to merge of AAdvantage, Dividend Miles. Each time, says call back Late Flightr. #30timesenough
@united the person is currently bettween gates 71A and 73 in LAX
@SouthwestAir OMG OMG OMG !!! I JUST DID!!
@AmericanAir what are the odds my bag was picked up by someone not me while in another country? Because it says it hasn't been located yet.
@JetBlue please get service started at @triflight and offer good routes lile florida upstate ny vegas etc
@JetBlue where exactly can I leave a note
@SouthwestAir Flight 3056. Only an hour long but one of the best flights I've ever had. Kudos to flight crew and airline in general.
@JetBlue with the free wifi #impressive #FlyFi http://t.co/T1RYpzEBc8
@united yes. Bags came 1 hr after I arrived at baggage claim. Awful experience on the ground at BHM
@AmericanAir yes, for tomorrow at 9 am. But I have to work though 😒 I'm really mad about the situation
@united It's an incredibly easy fix, but you would rather stay in your comfort zone, while I get forced out of mine.
@AmericanAir as your flight attendants are an extension of your brand - bitchy flight attendants on 5:30 am flights are not appreciated.
@AmericanAir - where are my bags? Baggage claim C25 or C26 (flt# 959)?? I can see the plane from here? Why does it take 25 min???
@USAirways Charlotte Staff needs prayer....disappointed in response to mishaps ......lotttttttt of pissed off people here!!!!
@united thank you so much. How will you be able to contact me?
@united been sitting on this plane 3:15 unreal. When will my 2+ day nightmare end?
@SouthwestAir It seems odd to be sitting on a plane that gets further delayed and you find out by txt, not the 6 emp working on the aircraft
@AmericanAir never got an update and we had the worst communication from u. Our flight delay was mechanical and not a word. #poorservice
@united Very good flight, thank you!
@USAirways 44 minutes on hold so far. And still haven't spoke to a human. Never using you again.
@JetBlue's new CEO Robin Hayes battles to appease passengers and Wall Street - Business In Savannah http://t.co/KKAY8XaPs1
@united is #ELP Friendly. #flyerfriendly #united #emb145 #elpaso http://t.co/9mEOzBO4xl
@united no I don't. Spoke with baggage contact at 1-800 number. Said they will try to get bags to stay at IAD for pick up tmrw
#Real RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/ERzht75kqZ
@JetBlue I would like to send an email to Lost and Found at JetBlue JFK; I spoke to them this morning but cannot drive their today.
@united cross country flight SFO&gt;BOS. No wifi, not even a can of soda and this quality inflight entertainment #sad http://t.co/xhlc30MTfF
@JetBlue @BucketObolts Same
@USAirways is absolute crap this week!!
@SouthwestAir : thanks.are flights operating now or Cancelled Flightled?
@AmericanAir appreciate update. Have also appreciated our pilots effort to explain to us just now. Accurate, authoritative comms is vital.
@USAirways US 728. One water run of the planet's smallest water bottles. Applaud you looking out for the environment.
@AmericanAir thanks. Now my carry on that you guys insisted be checked at the gate is missing. Won't be here till Late Flight tomorrow morning.
@united thanks we'll be in touch!
@united on 4124 arriving two hours Late Flight into CLT. Now sitting on the tarmac while they move a plane from the gate. Unhappy customer.
@USAirways  I will never fly us airways again.
@JetBlue Hey Jetblue, you Cancelled Flightled our flight from ST Maarten to JFK.  Stranded my family in the baggage area and lost my daughters luggage
@USAirways thanks :)
@SouthwestAir thanks, already subscribe and have a RR Account. Had received a promo code last month but has since expired. Any new offers?
@united they have access to the dial that makes it faster do they?
@JetBlue and of course that was supposed to say Logan, not login
@united they're not, actually. gate agent was so rude. now standing in a line waiting for reFlight Booking Problems. missed the only flight to STI. awful.
@JetBlue flight to Orlando is unable to serve hot bevies.... So they've made movies and alcohol complimentary. That works
@united used to (still do?) let you listen to flight radio...I often did...interesting to me #TCMParty #CE3K #31DaysOfOscar
@JetBlue what else on this plane is duct-taped?? #ohboy #shouldigetoutandpush #airplane #flying… http://t.co/R9ZsVzuRLw
@SouthwestAir so why is every single flight out of @PortColumbusCMH Cancelled Flightled for only your airline?
@USAirways No, they won't because after 5 hours of holding I had to give up because I couldn't borrow the phone any longer. 5 hours...
@AmericanAir It's not what happens to us that matters...It's our response that matters. Way to drop the ball AA.
@AmericanAir every time I try to call, it tells me to try again Late Flightr and just hangs up.
@united I am signed up for notifications. This is the first trip I was not updated on. Not sure why this happened.
@USAirways Seriously??? I have shared my concerns four times already, to NO avail!  Geeeeezzzzz! #frustrated flyer
@united Gate agent hooked me up with alternate flights. If you have a way to PREVENT the constant issues, that would rock.
@united Thank y'all for being an amazing airline who knows how to treat their customers. you guys rock!
@AmericanAir I picked the nonstop flight bc I had things to get to. Should’ve taken diff route or airline I suppose!
@AmericanAir I thought all those planes were retired? #MD80
@AmericanAir we are off to Kax premium.  Hoping this flight is better food, TV now I know how to work it and service. Tnx
@VirginAmerica thank you for checking in. tickets are purchased and customer is happy ;-)
@USAirways Any update on the computer outtage affecting flights? Is this national or just Northeast? ETA on resolution?
@USAirways Well I did miss it. But gate agents had rebooked boarding pass waiting when I landed. Time for lunch &amp; a beverage. Easy cheesy
@JetBlue Jua at JFK 'Just Ask' desk was incredibly helpful! Thanks!
@AmericanAir @Delta @JetBlue can you help? @SpiritAirlines is in the wrong, stuck in Florida 3days. They need to learn from real airlines.
@AmericanAir keep trying to call to change reservation and you keep hanging up on me
@SouthwestAir are people in an exit row still supposed to give their verbal approvals? I was never asked on the flight I'm on...
@JetBlue Mark T.  in Austin was great handling my bag issue.  #thanks
@AmericanAir QSVGRU when would the next flight arrive?
@USAirways you can't control the weather but you CAN control your systems, processes, people and attitudes. #anotherfail
@AmericanAir I Cancelled Flightled my ticket and is taking two months ++ to refund and still waiting!
@jetblue what good with the inflight WiFi?
@VirginAmerica Thanks!
@USAirways your service sucks.
@united since when did you get so good again!  4 transcontinental flights in 72h.  What a pleasure/relief you were.
@SouthwestAir has the worst customer service on earth. Will never fly that airline again.
@JetBlue No worries. Delay was minor and dealt with nicely. It was captain of flight 2324 by the way.
@usairways really need help asap, so please make it quick. Thx.
@united kind of cool to run into your boss man at SFO. http://t.co/bm9O2K5X5J
@USAirways flight 850. RUDE RUDE RUDE service! Awful.
@AmericanAir my flight 386 from Jacksonville fl to Dallas is showing Cancelled Flightled. What is going on?  Am I rebooked on another flight?
@USAirways thanks very much! I got thru on the phone &amp; everything is fine. Just love the website &amp; app ! Thanks for working on it!
@AmericanAir great, thanks!
@USAirways you call this a window seat? #airbus321seat14Fproblems http://t.co/ZKOE6clGiU
@JetBlue I'll give u a chance but I don't think I'll fall for it #backtodelta
@JetBlue Thanks!
@SouthwestAir sure did. Also read on there that Southwest doesn't believe it is liable for the incident. How is it my fault that SW lost it?
@SouthwestAir @CourtSnod hopefully Nashville is open. I want to come home today
@SouthwestAir almost bumped me off my flight to HRL when I was 20 minutes early then your staff was rude when I asked what was the problem?
@JetBlue Great service from PBI to HPN! Thanks.
@AmericanAir so disappointed with this airline never again will I book with you guys
@JetBlue Found someone to ask. No answers. Landed almost 40 minutes ago.
@SouthwestAir I knew I was correct! http://t.co/9eueYxAwcv
@VirginAmerica I love the hipster innovation. You are a feel good brand.
@SouthwestAir Thank you for your help Adam and to the awesome gate agents at B12 in LAS for getting us home!
@SouthwestAir been on hold for &gt;30 minutes about my Cancelled Flightled flight. Still not talked to anyone and flight is soon. What gives?
@AmericanAir if by near the gate you mean sitting on the plane for almost 2 hours, then yeah.
@SouthwestAir thank you for the confirmation. Maybe people on my flight have directional dislexia.
@JetBlue I was not allowed to drop my bag off for my flight that I was running 10min Late Flight for. Turns out it left over an hour Late Flight.
@united flight 1136 from Chicago to Houston over 2 hours and no pretzels or peanuts?! Seriously about passed out.
@united Thank you! You need to follow back tho otherwise I can't DM you. X
@SouthwestAir #1687 MDW-SAN. Like most flights, if I'm watching free TV it works but won't hardly access any websites - including your own.
@SouthwestAir any idea if there will be any "spring sales" soon for travel from Late Flight August to early September? Going from PA to LAX.
@AmericanAir - don't understand why I have zero Flt info- no email- 2 he wait time on ph lines- so much for Advan Mem :(
@united Terrific. Many thanks. Looking forward to being back on UA tomorrow. Had a great flight up to Vancouver.
@USAirways please help on hold 3 hours can't change flights I'm stuck here
@SouthwestAir no but seriously wtf? #nochill http://t.co/esd3XD5V1r
@JetBlue Shocked by misbehavior and cheap comments from jet airways staff to passenger at Delhi Airport Friday boarding to Dubai. Disgusting
@JetBlue The 13th Annual Martha's Vineyard African American Film Festival  August 10-15, 2015   Our attendees deserve a great flight to MV??
@VirginAmerica @ladygaga @carrieunderwood  love all three but you really can't beat the classics!
@AmericanAir you guys are killing me. http://t.co/22iPGeIcSm
@SouthwestAir Thank you - hung up after 1hr 7min on hold. Would you like me to DM you contact info?
Hey @AmericanAir why automated call me and then hang up at 4:45 am!?! And why can't I reschedule Cancelled Flighted flights via web!?! Come on!!!
@united My wife has been on the phone several times for past 3 days, with no result.
@SouthwestAir Is it possible to add companion to only the 2nd leg of a trip?
@JetBlue you guys rock!
@USAirways I have now called 12 times in the last three days. That's unacceptable. I'm willing to wait on hold, but that's not an option.
@AmericanAir Customer service provides no wiggle room to change flight without a $200 change fee. @southwest has always been accommodating.
@AmericanAir Reebooked for tomorrow in AA 1389 LV-DFW at 810 am arriving 12.50pm; still open this flight?
@united is the airline of the Oscars but doesn't carry ABC on Direct TV?!?! Fail - now I can't watch the Oscars. #united
@JetBlue aha, ok. Thanks! Was worried there might not be a seat at all :) Will do it at the airport tomorrow then!
@JetBlue she has...she hasn't heard from anyone in over a week. a nonstop flight and her baggage was lost/stolen. customer service 👎
@united this is getting ridiculous. Now we're missing our connection.
@united Nice "partners" you have. The delays keep increasing every 20 min @FtLauderdaleSun @orlandosentinel http://t.co/1AtEafnC6R
@JetBlue This is how you have me feeling.... http://t.co/esUu0hiAjM
@AmericanAir the group of minor children were broken up into groups. Some still in Miami. Delta has much better customer service!
@AmericanAir - cruel &amp; unusual to Cancelled Flight flight w/o notice &amp; make someone stay on hold for 30min &amp; listen to the same ad in a loop
@usairways @AmericanAir LAX connect from term 6 to term 4.  55min layover due to delay. US755-AA2595. Is this realistic? Can 2595 be held?
@united So far so good. Just stepped down in Denver. Next Stop Portland!
@usairways @BarclaycardUS 1 hr wait so far for customer service. yes bad weather but do air traffic controllers answer your phones?!??
@AmericanAir how about some rampers at gate b40 dfw?   Waiting to be marshaled in
@JetBlue boarding the back of the airplane first. Like a boss. #sosmart #jetblue #frequentflyerappreciates #alsoyayforsnacks
@USAirways @Truthh4 they didn't give you the wifi password? Smh
@united this may be the last time I fly your airline.
@USAirways It's a debit card, but I am a Dividend member.
@AmericanAir while I'm aggravated - shouldn't baggage fees disappear now that gas prices have dropped?
@USAirways thank you for reaching out to me. Hopefully my request will be fixed and I can remain a loyal customer.
@AmericanAir - don't be jealous.  I live in Sydney and my T-shirt and jeans don't suit the office for work. I need suits and a warm jacket.
@SouthwestAir   Where the heck are the bags for Chicago 408. It has been an hour
@AmericanAir Hi ho, hi ho. It's off to work I go. #WeeklyCommuteOnAA http://t.co/JQHg4jTm4w
@united what is the problem with your flights to ny today
@AmericanAir Trying to find out if flight #340 DFW to HOU is on tonight. Exec platinum desk not calling back and online info not clear.
@AmericanAir it's taken care of already. I've come to expect this level of horrible service from you time and time again
@JetBlue that's ok! It just sure seemed like it when JetBlue tweeted us back and asked us to send selfies of us watching.. Haha
@united  flight 441 on 2/4 was delayed over three hours because the pilot never showed up!
@united @laurasbrown5 Clearly United lives in the stone age. Some people don't need computers, make your site better for tablets and phones
@united @Lmuschel he is traveling with me on a sep reservation number F3KxB8
@AmericanAir she should not only get a refund but also an apology for the deplorable service.
@JetBlue @CookJaycook123 the only update we get is that they have no idea when we will get an update. Way to go. #hopeless
@united we still need help. Hung up on twice. Customer service rep said there is no way to help between the gate rep and phone rep.
@USAirways i've been on hold for an hour trying to change my flight!!! COME ON
@united gave me a smile today, with a Zero Award... ;-) Computers have some sense of humour :-) http://t.co/JNqNbk7HuT
@united What's up with the reduction in E+ on 737-900s? 1K who can no longer confirm E+.  Forget upgrades - just want legroom. #unitedfail
@USAirways I will. Thank you for at least tweeting me back:) better than most. 👌
@JetBlue being told JFK had a 5 hour delay this AM which is reason for my delay now. It can't be that hard to notify with 12 hours notice
@USAirways never imagined it would be so hard to SPEND money through US Air. Stubbornly hoping someone will come back to the phone.
@AmericanAir it wasn't ' disrupted' it was Cancelled Flightled. Airport agents were horrendous. Sharon was your saviour
@AmericanAir Joanna is wonderful, new flight booked by a very friendly and helpful agent during a very stressful day! Thank You!
@AmericanAir 1st leg of my flight 2 nyc tomorrow has been Cancelled Flightled. if you make me hold for 2hrs i may miss my only chance back home!
@AmericanAir why does it feel like I'm being nickeled and dime to enjoy a flight with AA? I purchased a tkt but have to pay extra for a seat
@AmericanAir you know I love this airline, but why are my friends @MEGENTRIPODI @jordnnicole7 having such a problem retaining info they need
@USAirways stuck on the runway for 2 hrs 10 min due to weather in PHL. Nowhere can I find accurate info on #558 to BOS
@united shes been rescheduled for today, but with the frigid cold, being a possible reason for "maintenance" it could be the same issue 2day
@AmericanAir is the 24/7 phone line open? On hold for over 2 hours now. Your check-in agents cannot help at the airport itself. Please help.
@AmericanAir it is absolutely unacceptable.  I have been calling all day and am hung up on every time. I just need a 5 minute bit of help!
@USAirways What is happening? Have been sitting in Philly for hours. Pls take care of Flight 759 to Chicago. At least least us know! #soLate Flight
@USAirways why don't you hire people to deal with the call volume, this is absolute garbage #incompetent
@united you have yourselves to blame for giving me the time to get drunk and tell you how I feel about your overpriced sub par airline
@USAirways as the employee responsible for social media content, yes u probably do care however the actions from last night say otherwise
@SouthwestAir sent. looking for that functionality in your app, though. should be a one click action.
@USAirways should, but didn’t.
@united I'm sorry it's cold in chicago, but I don't see why that means it takes 45 minutes for my priority bag to show up on the carousel.
@USAirways this says it was estimated to leave an hour ago (it hasn't left yet) so thanks for this useful information. #TheWorstAirline
@JetBlue thanks for making me miss an important dinner tonight. 2 hr delay and now 20 min on Tarmac... #worst
@USAirways now on hold for 90 minutes
@united I didn't get a message from you. I'll resend numbers.
@JetBlue So anything found while cleaning the plane in DC would be at the baggage office, even something small?
@USAirways You won't give us a hotel or food. Can you at least suggestion options for making it to the metro city I have a ticket to?
@USAirways thank you
@AmericanAir on top of that my online record was unavailable as well and then couldn't get anyone on the phone.
@AmericanAir @russelneiss No, American. This is simple. How about YOU call HER back with the info for her new flight. Basic customer service
@AmericanAir ticks me off.
@SouthwestAir - you can do better than having someone on hold for over an hr http://t.co/FxNv618B1A
@united I booked and paid for a flight to get me to Denver at a specific time for a meeting. You failed... It wasn't caused by weather
@AmericanAir no you're not you're trying to book me PAST when i need 2 arrive but you're still selling seats on the day I'm trying 2 travel
@VirginAmerica I'd love to know what your policy is for damaged luggage.
@AmericanAir this receipt doesn't show the evoucher value nor does it mention having used an evoucher
@USAirways flight 614 keeps telling a few more mins to take off its been an hour. First time with you not the best #lies #brokenpromises
@AmericanAir said that AA does not provide in-flight wifi on the routes to China based on some federal laws, but United does, why is that?
@USAirways on hold with 800-428-4322. Flight from DSM to DCA was Cancelled Flighted (4473). Know when it will fly?
@USAirways 2 hours and 7 minutes. Just want to know I'm still in the queue...
@united flight ua3576, gate b1. And tell ray I somehow made it on to the 736 flight out of IAH and didn't have to wait for the 917 one. :)
@USAirways I checked in "Standby for 1st Class" only to find I am "not on the list". This merger is a pain.
@united I don't see how I need to spend an extra $100 bc of ur equipment failure.
@united Flight Cancelled Flightled to BDL and stranded @Dulles_Airport. Waiting almost 2hrs at customer service. Shout out to diligent agents.
@SouthwestAir to end its daily #B737-700 flights from #Washington Reagan to #FtMyers on 8AUG #avgeek
“@united: @rikrik__ What made you come to this? Can we help you with anything? ^JP” the service just hasn't been great.
@USAirways is anything being done to make Flight Attendants aware of AA member benefits? Embarrassing being argued with. Just happened.
@AmericanAir no; I just expect a higher level of customer service &amp; for the flight crews to give us accurate information
@AmericanAir Just took off. Sitting with someone who is scheduled on Buenos ares out of JFK,not sre if he will make it. R thy holding plane?
@JetBlue @ZKatcher @bretharold does it look like to we talked to customer service? http://t.co/vYUAnh4Iqr
@JetBlue Walked down the hall to Carousel 8...found all bags sitting there. Still no words from crew...signage still not updated
@USAirways you denied a mom her AM flight because she NEEDED her breast pumping parts on a full flight? Please FIX this ASAP!! #freeflight
@AmericanAir I wrote down the evoucher number. I got rid of the voucher when I purchased air fair
@USAirways only happened because u couldn't get us home the next day. #flydelta #flysouthwest #flyjetblue #theyareallbetter #stillnobags
@AmericanAir None of the #LAX flights into #DFW have been Cancelled Flightled. Those landing before and after ours are fine. Completely arbitrary.
@USAirways Missed flight. Rude CSR. No flight till Tuesday. No answer on twitter. Help me out with a RT @pattonoswalt you're my only hope.
@AmericanAir thanks!!
@JetBlue thank you for taking care of me with a drink since my in-flight entertainment wasn't working #goodcustomerservice
@AmericanAir Great seats on this aircraft!
@SouthwestAir So today I call into Customer Service &amp; speak with Wendell Holton in the Dallas office &amp; I am told there is nothing he can do
@VirginAmerica really wish you'd fly out of #Fargo @fargoairport those fares are amazings
@AmericanAir AA2334 Second week in a row delayed, due to mechanical issues. All the sleet outside and yet we're stuck changing a tire
@JetBlue @airbusintheus A320 landing @aruba_airport in February of 2014. #avgeek #warmweather https://t.co/Kaej9G0CHd
@USAirways according to @wtop DCA seems to be recovering nicely from yesterday's snow so why are you Cancelled Flightling flights out there?
@AmericanAir its only 1500 characters, i will respond via formal letter. Trust me, I have plenty to say.
@AmericanAir make that 7hours now
@USAirways They were breathing very heavily. but were super helpful. Thank you.
Why? 😒 RT @JetBlue Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/I7Ut2ZvHCO
@AmericanAir why are there only 2 agents at domestic check in at MIA?! WTF? Huge lines and many people with Cancelled Flightled flights.
@united Then why did your staff refuse to let ME on the earlier flight citing my having checked a bag?!?!
@united all good! Next flight was a little delayed so it all worked 👍
@JetBlue - Hopefully that will help someone in the future. Would there have been a different procedure if I had discovered the theft sooner?
@united In the process of recovering their car rental - condo rental $ in Florida. They called #United for an alternate flight #NOANSWER
😩😩😩 “@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/46am1BSi2G”
@JetBlue Flight 136 departs 2:14 AM  Finally!!!  Arrived JFK with no psgrs at 5:39 PM.  That's a long flight. AKA BUS http://t.co/KfKjF1ZtGi
@USAirways Flt 4609 landed over half an hour ago. Not a single bag yet on the baggage claim. Hate you so much right now.
@AmericanAir I am honestly in shock how this process and service compares to my other airline experiences. Not really sure what to say...
@SouthwestAir you guys need better communication to your customers. This is rude and unprofessional.
@JetBlue Am I the only one who had to look that up? I must be getting old... #damn
@united How can you not know where my bags are?  You knew where they were 6 hours ago. You are killing me!  Worst service. Ever.
@USAirways yes and our flight attendant (who is wonderful btw) secured the tray table so it's not flailing about. http://t.co/JhXWMuTx4G
@SouthwestAir Thanks for two smooth, safe and fast flights! #Boston #Houston #LUVSWA http://t.co/elhxUV0Uj1
@SouthwestAir I understand. But it's consistent, and been consistent for years. It's known around the country.
@USAirways thanks so much!
@AmericanAir Hi guys checking in US/AA 639 JFK PHX and renewed Admirals Club today.
Alright... Someone has to stop this! RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/lchVJoliDg
@SouthwestAir is having a party in the atl terminal. #letitgo http://t.co/qxTeqZm3yz
@united when will I hear? Guitar was damaged in December. I use my guitar to earn a living. Get your act together!
@AmericanAir I'll be sticking with @southwest in the future. No change fees, first bag free, and stellar customer service.
@usairways Need to change div miles ticket after travel started due to weather advisory. Told not possible unless flight Cancelled Flightled. AnyHelp?
@united My favorite way to travel! Thank you! http://t.co/vGN2X1ckg0
@JetBlue you really should be more proactive with passengers when you know the entertainment system isn't working. At least let me get a mag
@JetBlue is REALLY getting on my nerves !! 😡😡 #nothappy
@united gate C 24 IAD. U released passengers to board w/others deplaning .50 peopleOn bridge while next flight  board http://t.co/HfoF33iyhi

@USAirways over 15min hold on your reservation line. embarrassing. AA Platinum member.
@united 3 hour 45 min delay so far..... Would love to round to 4 hours to just go to bed!
@AmericanAir after all, the plane didn’t land in identical or worse) conditions at GRK according to METARs.
@AmericanAir I can't choose a seat online because I booked on @priceline ??? #SMH
@VirginAmerica fav airline
@JetBlue what is going on? We arrived at 10:51pm Not One Bag Has Been Unloaded!! Flight 424
@AmericanAir @derekc21  Hello any one out there ? have you forgotten me ?  I need a  luggage # for BA.  Your dropping the ball here .
@SouthwestAir baggage woman said it was in Blatimore and would be on a plane this morning. Now they can't find it. WTF!???
@JetBlue @KleinErin Hi! Know a pastor or homeschool mom who might like SpiritED? Have 'em contact me on Prefundia:http://t.co/jRbZLHRW7y
@SouthwestAir too long to wait for bags when they could have been on the next flight out. The party of 4 could have waited in Albany
@united Trying to change a flight booked just 6 hours ago but online system is charging me $200 fee per passenger... could you please help?
@SouthwestAir you cx'ed almost the entire east coast flights All other planes are taking off any traveling fine I need to get to Nev ASAP
@southwestair three flights with three  check in agents, not enough. #missedflight  back to Jet Blue
@united how does that help me with my customers that I couldn't meet with (and subsequently lost)?
@SouthwestAir how often are airplane seats/tray tables cleaned and sanitized? rather have air purifier and clean seats than #wifi 😷😱
@united yet again you disappoint. Sitting at IAD for UA3728 for 3.5hrs and you can't seem to know why the plane hasn't left Albany. #Fail
@AmericanAir been waiting in line for over an hour in San Antonio, barely moved &amp; only two agents. 30 in front of me &amp; at least 40 behind.
@USAirways Frustrating days!No flights home, changed airlines. Thank you PHL USAirway employees &amp; @united for help getting me back to IAH.
@united is UA938 still taking off at 9:05pm? I'm stuck on the tarmac on UA3462 waiting to get in.
@USAirways I tried that before using Twitter. Also gave me no helpful information. Thank you anyway
@united yes, would love an upgrade or voucher,  please give me a call 9148445695
@AmericanAir Traveling with my infant: Do you check the carseat for free? If so, do you provide a bag? Someone told me but wanted to confirm
@united hello. I'm overseas &amp; my bag is lost. I can't call customer service but can you help me?
@USAirways cannot book to redeem companion fair without speaking to agent. $99 vs $1200, this is a family emergency #unacceptable
@USAirways If I know I left something on my last flight (as I literally had to run to make my connection), how can I retrieve it please?
@united Flight delayed 40 minutes in ORD because plane didn’t have all the food. That should be fixed in the future. It’s a dumb delay.
@JetBlue You guys really suck! I just spent 40 minutes on the phone linking my credits to my account.  They are still NOT there! 1/2
@united the staff was rather efficient and got us solutions just freaked me out a little being in limbo in the air.
@AmericanAir awesome flight this morning on AA3230! Awesome crew and even landed early!
@AmericanAir that's unacceptable. They should allow me to wait on hold, or take my number and call me themselves.
@USAirways i have and you have not been able to locate them, its insane. i trust you and PAY you to look after my things and you lost them.
@united I'll be calling tomorrow
@united lots of reports of system failures delaying flights over the last week. Currently sitting on the tarmac at OGG for over an hour.
@SouthwestAir Cancelled Flightled my flight won't refund me and told me 2 call customer service n been holding for 30 minutes still waitin #BadService
@united 3 hours of sitting in the plane that hasn't left the Gate yet. 6 more hours of actual flying left.
@united tried other flight options as per weblink, non available for next 2 days, frustrating #notgoodenough #poorservice
@USAirways Look into better service.
“@USAirways: @AnnetteNaif We appreciate the #shoutout for Roberto. DM confirmation code so we can forward ur kind words.” Confirmation code?
@united $7 for wifi just so I can tell my family I'm gonna be Late Flight cause i had to sit in a grounded plane for the past two hours...
@USAirways CSTSVC in PHL honors UR system over my reality. No RCD of change in HPN. Now extra hours in PHL or $75 to get to CLE.
@USAirways how do you do that? You guys need to have much better communication. How? How can we do that?
@AmericanAir sent
@united you need to retrain your flight attendants. Saying there is no more room for carry ons when there actually is, is not cool.
@JetBlue @TatianaKing @thewayoftheid I feel only a few free travel vouchers will assuage my indignation.
@AmericanAir thanks!
@united thanks. Just got on a couple of minutes ago. Great service on flight 479 btw. Please pass it to the team on that flight.
@JetBlue Yesterday on my way from EWR to FLL just after take-off. :)#wheelsup #JetBlueSoFly http://t.co/9xkiy0Kq2j
@SouthwestAir once or twice a year. Hard to get vacation time from work sometimes. But love flying with you guys!
@USAirways of course weather was a joke 43 beats 5 degrees in PHL! ⛄️☀️
@AmericanAir how can I get you guys to respond to my tweets and DM??? Really sad feeling to be ignored.
@AmericanAir @Clarkey_19 we done it with 1 truck... No biggie 😄
@united you all do a wonderful job today. Got my wife, daughter, and myself from PGH to Orlando after out flight was delayed luggage and all
@JetBlue Just looking to arrange for a nice flight from SEA to LA-ish and comparing the cost to something more direct from YVR.
@united 65 and 72 year old flying to Tokyo for vacation both with bad knees and this happens https://t.co/72RMpkOGwu @cbcallinaday @CBCNews
@USAirways 2 hours?! And just got disconnected.
@JetBlue What else could possibly take the place of coffee at that hour??Hope pilot wasn't relying on aircraft for caffeine. #needcoffee
@SouthwestAir wifi is the worst $8 investment I have ever made.
@southwestair this inflight WIFI is the absolute worst. I'd be willing to have paid double for dialup speeds...  #Flight7
@united  Delay DEN-CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this 1ker. #friendlyskies??
@united what is this subtlety gate changes? Are you kidding with me?
@SouthwestAir your welcome. It was the thoughts of nearly the entire plane.
@united thanks for ruined my vacation for having poorly maintained aircrafts that can’t fly safely out of STT. #UA1481 #Cancelled Flightledflight
@united in other words... sorry, not sorry.  Plenty of other airlines... and I travel A LOT.
@united yes please. Going to drive the 6 hours.
@USAirways nothing like back to back delayed flights let hope this one isn't 12 hours like the last time.
@united #UnitedAirlines Pls Fix #AspenBaggageFail issues. Had to pay my own way to #Aspen after flight Cancelled Flight. Left us in the cold in DEN.
@united Ok thank you, do you provide complimentary hotel accommodations since I'll have to stay overnight?
@USAirways What's the contact number for the corporate baggage office in Phoenix?
@united flying gla-mco in a few weeks. How long do we have to be at airport for before departure for both international and domestic? Ta

@JetBlue thank you very very much!! 💙💙
@SouthwestAir Awesome - thanks!
@USAirways attempting ckin for flight on 2/19 all day, site unable to retrieve details.  Called twice and disconnected.

@JetBlue 6am Austin to JFK
@USAirways @British_Airways three hour flight delay. On the phone for 45min and counting.
@united even with the multiplier the ticket price will still never equal the amount of miles you travel, even for transatlantic flights!
@AmericanAir Yeah, try harder. No catering truck in sight.  Can we just leave now w/o the food won't eat anyway?
@SouthwestAir looks like you are up and running for the day. Still can't get through on the phone. Can you follow so I can dm you my info
“@AmericanAir Thanks for info on super large passengers- the extra seat Mr. Big needed was the one i was sitting in already #customerservice
@JetBlue I just wanted to say flight attendant fitz was the best tonight on flight #1326 bwi/Bos. Great guy and made the flight fantastic!
@united so glad I've been waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes and Ive been transferred 3 times without resolving anything. Worst service ever.
@SouthwestAir what about for us that cant get to the states they are playing for the hunt? Any DestinationDragons tickets left?Even just one
@united absolutely disgusting the way you treat your customers. Isn't there anyone actively monitoring your Cust serve? This is  unreal!!
@JetBlue should I check in my awesome bag on my flight or carry it on... Decisions...
@USAirways the ads on your phone systems when waiting for a rep is the most annoying thing ever especially when waiting for over 10 mins...
@USAirways thank you!!
@united He needs to get to home the 24th, they're telling him it'll be the 25th @ night. Is there compensation or anything that can be done?
@united all set. Figured it out at the baggage office!

@AmericanAir @nrosenb1 It's not allowing me to book available seats

@SouthwestAir flight Cancelled Flightled. new flight 7 hours Late Flightr. will sleep in airport tonight. and cant even give me an A Boarding Group seat. thx
@united thank you for dishonoring my upgrade and putting me in a seat I didn't want, all while not even notifying me.  Great 1K service 👎
@AmericanAir it's always nice coming home but I wish you'd fly LAX-MAD and keep me away from Iberia 😜✈️ #GoingForGreat
@SouthwestAir- ...was only less than 3500pts, but it helped. Had PartnerRewards incoming, but not fast enough to keep pts from expiring.
@AmericanAir said that AA does not provide in-flight wifi on the routes to China based on some federal laws, but United does, why is that?
@USAirways thanks for taking my flight off the board AND NOT PROVIDING and updates about my flight which is 26 minutes Late Flight.
@USAirways me and my wife will be flying out of atlanta to vegas on March 7th since couldn't get any out of tricities here in Tn
@AmericanAir you've got to be kidding. Look at the pictures.  I'm hoping it's on the flight that just came in. The whole story is 2 much
@SouthwestAir will you please tell me if I'll make my flight out of here tomorrow 8am? I've been tryin for 3 days now to leave
@USAirways Appreciate the calls when flight's delayed, but the recorded msg is tedious &amp; just goes on &amp; on. I vote for texts if practical :)
@united still missing my luggage, was promised someone would call, no call so far, flight from Shanghai to DC with connecting flight in ORD
@AmericanAir I paid using Paypal online and after I was charged there was a "System Error" which is what I ended up calling about.
@united It is super frustrating that the folks at the United Ticket Counter in Pittsburg aren't honoring their own Media Rate! #unitedfail
@JetBlue Utah, I think. And thanks!
@united new flight has me at the window. Kind of ticked off. I pick aisle seats only because I hate window seats. #annoyed #EpicFail
@JetBlue thanks

@AmericanAir I can't get ahold of aadvantage reservations.  I need to ticket a reservation that Cancelled Flights soon.  can you help?
@USAirways The phone line disconnects. How can I be in the queue to be answered when the phone line simply disconnects when I call?
@USAirways @VincesViews  there are significant number of folks on 686 connecting to 599 a few minutes hold would make many happy
@united nice your app says US 4972 delayed by weather.  Pilot says waiting on fuel.  One in ur control, one not
@United line up @iah #IAH @AirlineGeeks #avgeek http://t.co/dJHXvJT201

@JetBlue marks 15th year with new "Bluemanity" plane design - Sun Sentinel http://t.co/SjVEelween
@JetBlue everytime I come back to Boston it's a minimum 45 min wait for bags. Earlier it was almost an hour. Why is it only Boston jetblue?
@SouthwestAir thanks for the great customer service today! 👍👌
@united you ask a lot of customers who  you routinely screw over. You know that, right?
@VirginAmerica Nice to see you expanding in Texas but don't forget about us here in #SanDiego. I would love to see more flights out of here!
@united Coach interior on UA 992 looked like it was salvaged from the 80s. Tiny unusable video, no power &amp; lifevests on the floor #UA992 …
@SouthwestAir been dealing with multiple offices for the last 3 days. Youve completely lost me as a customer unless my bag is back to me.
@united Another awful experience and Victoria at the check in desk in STL could not have been more rude and condescending.
@SouthwestAir Yes, please.
@AmericanAir delayed flight six hours. Missed international connection= extra night in a hotel and still have to pay for a 15lb surfboardbag
@AmericanAir hi do you have a phone number to ring from uk regarding claim for our Late Flight flight departure claim amount agreed just had no
@united Flt 359 lax to EWR. Your pilot bragged about getting to EWR early only to wait 20 min for a jetway driver. Thanks United!
@SouthwestAir much respect!
@united done as requested.
@united really? 3 hr delay, 4 gate changes, &amp; you boarded us, sent us back up, &amp; boarded us again.  Won't change our flight. Can we go now?
@SouthwestAir reference #: 261093929756
@united yes in Lusaka, Zambia. My guess is the bags never made the plane at IAD.
@USAirways attendants at the gate. Enjoyed watching the other flight to our destination take off before having a horrible attendant give us
@AmericanAir on flight 1074 that has been delayed for hours over human errors like a food truck hitting the plane, now the lines are frozen.
@SouthwestAir on hold now for 1 Hour 25 mins Whats the holdup
@united doing a good thing, holding flight for a few for 11 peeps on Late Flight connecting flight. We'll still make destination on time
@AmericanAir on hold for 3 hours...got an agent, immediately txfd me to change cncdld flight...told it would be 1 min, 80 min Late Flightr, waiting
@VirginAmerica wifi AND better seating.
@SouthwestAir I'm smashed into a window by the giant guest sitting next to me. #4386. No way this guy should have been given 1 seat.
@AmericanAir Can you add my KTN to an existing reservation? It's not letting me add it online....
@USAirways ...was Cancelled Flightled and now I need to locate my baggage
@united well played, ^LO.
@AmericanAir I have been checking consistently, and called multiple times. As a loyal AA customer, I'm disappointed.
@united we need a new flight to Tucson
@SouthwestAir thank you for integrating with Passbook on iOS, it all works so much better now!!!
@SouthwestAir Thanks. 436. Only a minor delay so not a big deal. :)Appreciate the concern though. Boarding now. You do have amazing service!
@SouthwestAir was on flight 2373 from CHI-BUF last night, almost 2 hour delay cuz someone got on the plane without a pass - sounds safe. 1/2
@united We've had a ton of problems with getting our bags and have been given the run around for a day. Whats up with that?
Why doesn't @AmericanAir allow for conversations between upset customers and their customer service?  #worstcustomerserviceever
@AmericanAir boarding in 2mins YAY!!!!
@AmericanAir bought a ticket on @SouthwestAir. After two days, your "team" couldn't share the data needed to get me to my next meeting.
@SouthwestAir What are your services? What promotion you have at the moment? #ModeloDeNegocio #innovation #innovacion #BusinessModel
@SouthwestAir why are flights still getting out of Logan now? You couldn't manage to get one out at 6 AM, when it wasn't snowing!
@AmericanAir tried that and can't get through.
@SouthwestAir the wait for the bags is longer than the actual flight.
@united I don't need to make any changes. I reserved my seats when I bought my tickets and there was an error &amp; now there are no comp seats
@USAirways I need help. In air on #717 to CLT from PHL. Conf: D1MQF5 Need confirmed on #1776 to BNA at 10:30. Been bumped all day, need home

@AmericanAir she has  the guy u served drinks 2  til he needed awheelchair to get off the plane is a more important then the assaulted women
@USAirways got off stand by list and on earlier flight to DCA. What is the status of my checked bag? Was supposed to be on #4047 thanks
@AmericanAir are you a bot? Haha always same lies from you!
@JetBlue Fliers to Gain Access to WSJ Content - @zacks_com http://t.co/GouzrdT7ZF
@JetBlue they are rude and unhelpful. They suggested I catch a flight tomorrow I was supposed to be home today at 2 am and work is waiting
@AmericanAir If SNA curfew causes diversion, do you provide transportation from LAX? On AA1237 now, pilot not sure if we have time.
@SouthwestAir Incredible view! I had a smooth flight both ways even tho there was turbulence. Your pilots ROCK! http://t.co/3nsUSfSBPv
@united ... I want my bag off flight 1142, what do I do now?
@USAirways I appreciate your prompt response.
@SouthwestAir would love to win tickets and take my son to Imagine Dragons in Provo Saturday night.  Crossed fingers. #DestinationDragons
@united cabin pressurization issues are pretty serious. Flight 1109 landed in Washington because of it. My head is pounding.
@SouthwestAir I'm on the 110 lol has anyone arrived yet??
@SouthwestAir appreciate the reply, hopefully those LAX agents get the memo. Cheers!
@SouthwestAir Switching planes due to mechanical problems.  How does reboarding work? Was A49, now at end of long line.  Stuck in middle?
@united second time flying into Houston and 45+ mins waiting for luggage at baggage. Typical? Still waiting..
@USAirways Well, that's a problem considering I need to book a flight tonight for this weekend... is there anything you can do?
@united I am calling to check on a future flight and your first agent hung up and now you sent me to the pet travel line!! This is HELL!!
@united I would take the $500 voucher you offered for MISCOUNTING THE # OF SEATS ON YOUR PLANE but that means I would have to fly you again
@AmericanAir I just sent a DM
@AmericanAir Close down
@SouthwestAir can you show me some luv?Its 9 degrees and all this snow but Imdetermined to go to #DestinationDragons http://t.co/oXm6cWGaB7
@united thanks for the reply.  If you can get me a better seat on my next leg to Munich. That would be nice.
@JetBlue I would like to receive offers.
@united Do you have plans for an iPad app?  The iPhone app is great, but on the  iPad you have to flip the iPad.  Is there a beta? Tks.
.@united call my work and tell them it's your fault I'm Late Flight
@USAirways  sitting on Tarmac in #PIT for 30 min. No announcement. Just sitting.
@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine friendliest employees
@VirginAmerica I was so looking forward to my first flight with you today but it was Cancelled Flightled along with the subsequent one ...
@SouthwestAir I would love to go to the #DestinationDragons @ImagineDragons show tomorrow in Utah at @VelourLive! I've been trying so hard.
@SouthwestAir honesty should always be the policy
@VirginAmerica I rang, but there is a wait for 35 minutes!! I can book the same ticket through a vendor, fix your site
Don't show these to Larry Fedora. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/qqlzk2jkzR
@AmericanAir 250 I'm not sure if I'm rebooked now. In a line at airport trying to work it out. The earlier I can get to SFO the better:(
@JetBlue well I'm glad I got up at 5 am so I can sit in an airport.  No place else I'd rather be (not)
@USAirways how is your gate agent gonna tell me my flight is on time when its 5 minutes past departure time and the previous flights plane..
@USAirways @AmericanAir  ..off to vegas http://t.co/AygAOeB6Uu
@JetBlue all day
@united looks like I'm settled in to where I'm going.  Thx.
@SouthwestAir Apparently mechanics had to be flown in to fix some planes...not the most assuring sign
@USAirways Exicted to be flying with y'all soon !!
@USAirways I have 2d and 3d embossed badges and patches superior to the ones you are currently using. http://t.co/3fq3XElbOn
@SouthwestAir once again on Glassdoor's Best Places To Work snagging # 15 overall #notsurprising #LUVthem
@SouthwestAir from groupA to group C. We have never got to sit next to each other on any south west flight not even on our honey moon
@VirginAmerica I was so glad it was mentioned. I took my first virgin flight a few years back and it was a transformative experience.
@united Not until tomorrow night. And the hotel voucher had higher rate than travelocity Not loving cost, but hard working staff
@united They held the plane! Made it!!
@USAirways landed at Phoenix, but we had to board a flight quickly to Vegas so no time at the airport. What now?
@united worst service ever 😈
@AmericanAir right so I missed my connection / had a three hour Kay over / then you lost my bag.
@united I mean is there a real live person somewhere I can go and speak to at Newark post security?
@united I will be patient in my luxurious middle seat on my next delayed flight
@USAirways  flight missed due to mech issue. No food voucher, transported to different airport, no rental reimbursement 😡
@USAirways I do to as I have an afternoon Conference in Las Vegas and I would rather plan ahead than run thru the airport and then attempt
@AmericanAir One hour to check in is 45 minutes too long. MIA FAIL.
@USAirways what's going on? I've been hearing a not-friendly 'Please wait' on repeat while I'm on hold, being transferred to idk where...
@SouthwestAir @MegElizabeth631 how you like the #redcarpet treatment
@SouthwestAir Thank you.  Twitter says I can't DM someone unless they follow me.  Can @SouthwestAir follows my twitter?
@JetBlue I'll take 3 round trip tickets to the closest warmest place please! #negativedegrees #buffalo #snowwillnevermelt
Can You please help to save my daughters life @JetBlue for details Go here @Help_Lindsey
@AmericanAir I've been on hold for 55 mins about my Cancelled Flighted international flight. Am out of country, so can't leave a call back #. Help?
@USAirways thanks! http://t.co/pD7R1lL6Re
@united tried that. Cannot figure out where to go to get it.
@SouthwestAir is really stepping up their "service"🐩 http://t.co/VQTyza6Mzu
@USAirways So frustrating because I still have not gotten them back. Why my bag was sent to NY is a mystery!  Shame on me this time!
@united well perhaps you could highlight where that is stated.  We travel between Canada &amp; USA on United with only Nexus
@AmericanAir simply amazing. Smiles for miles.Thank u for my upgrade tomorrow for ORD.We are spending a lot of time together next few weeks!
@united I was on UA1069 today and left my sunglasses in seat 26F. Please help me get them back! #UnitedAirlines
@USAirways Flight 830 CLT to Phl. I was 1st on list.Someone else got spot. Rude employee in coach. Wouldt give ID. Said he was cute red head
@AmericanAir thank you. They are processing my refund.
OMGee!!! @JetBlue #OnFleek Why @JetBlue Why?!? 😭😁😆😵 How many people even know what that means, lol?
@united I'm DMing my info and no is assisting. My flight home left before m first flight had even landed
@united That is not what your reservations desk just told me.  They said there were plenty of seats
@AmericanAir Please try it yourself - call 1-800-433-7300 and see what happens... then you'll understand.  #allrepresentativesbusy #nooption
@USAirways looking forward to waiting on hold for 9 hrs to reschedule my flight.  Bunch of idiots work for this airline.
@united did  bags make it on the flight out of iad? second day without clothes is pretty inconvenient. We're pretty curious #UnitedAirlines
@USAirways made it.. Never ran so fast in my life
@USAirways if you actually cared about what you did it would be one thing. Sounds like you don't like being told how lousy your service is.
@united Any luck with finalizing my reservation? I DM'd information to you. Please let me know what else you need. Want to confirm ASAP. Thx
@AmericanAir not anymore.
@AmericanAir ok, I just received an email with my registration from your team. Thanks a lot
@SouthwestAir flight to San Diego is delayed per usual.. take me home!
@AmericanAir flight 45 JFK-LAS. First the catering was Late Flight, the. No push back crew. 2hrs delay.
@united - it's been almost 2 weeks and still no word from DOT on update of london fare to us cities? any updates on your end?
@SouthwestAir first you had a good idea thatthis would happen and did not Cancelled Flight it earlier, then very amateurish that there was no plan.
@USAirways #ShoutOut 2 Kristie(sp?) from Gate4 @ PVD today. She's a #RockStar, was a tremendous help in a tough situation. #PromoteThatGirl
@united Are the current on board food menus available anywhere online?
@JetBlue Maybe I'll just go to Cleveland instead.
@USAirways you can send my luggage to my house👋
@AmericanAir first the pilot, then the catering...
@AmericanAir when will the merging of miles between you and @USAirways be complete? Wasn't it this month?
@AmericanAir Okay... If someone does it look for it now my fear is it will be lost forever. It's a very small item.
@SouthwestAir aww thanks!! Other than that, love it!
@JetBlue's CEO battles to appease passengers and Wall Street - http://t.co/uy28D1UEgX http://t.co/vJFV7KSGcQ
@united have since dropped to 2 layovers but still not acceptable.
@united Everyone around us is sitting with their friends and family members. They booked their tickets in October and December. We bought
@VirginAmerica I don’t use Passbook =/ I still love you though &lt;3 :) I’ll just use my email in the future.
@SouthwestAir thanks! More concerned about the conflicting texts I was receiving my about my flight  Having to drive 10 hours now 😢
@united not completely.  Our flight was changed in July but we never received notification.
@SouthwestAir want to explain why I was on hold for 2+ hrs tonight trying to reach customer service only to learn they're only there Mon-Fr?
@united #vegan meals can be more creative than noodles, peas, and zukes. Non-vegan yogurt is not acceptable for a vegan. Can you do better?
@SouthwestAir any delays today @CAKairport to Orlando?
@united Thanks, but not so much the missing bag as the nonexistent staff at this apparent remote outpost (busy airport for city of ~1M).
@united please do! She went above and beyond what she had to do, she made us her number one priority!
@united: I don't care that a @thehipmunk link showed me a "wrong" price on your site—it's your site &amp; responsibility to ensure correctness.
@SouthwestAir if a passngr requires wheelchair to gt on plane then sits in an exit row, wld they b physically capable to help in emergency?
@SouthwestAir @tbuccheriFRNC3E. It takes 13.5 hours to fly from Chicago to Beijing on United, and 12 to fly from Vegas to Omaha on SW...
@USAirways a flight update doesn't help when we are waiting 20+ min at our arrival waiting for a plane to leave our gate. Who can I write?😑
@united What a really GREAT &amp; FLATTERING story about you! You should be very proud :) http://t.co/oKtUkjY92O (via @ParachuteGuy)
@USAirways / @AmericanAir was the worst experience I've ever had flying. Rude, delays, Cancelled Flightlations, lack of updates, and wasting our time
@united I have no way to contact her while she is in flight. This does not work for me. Her father is about to pass and is heading to Denver
@united you know it's bad when you're praying your connecting flight is delayed because of an hour delay on the first flight #JustGetMeHome
@USAirways your staff at LAX really messed up on this one. Failing to scan my suitcase tag.
@united great to hear Thankyou so much. Greatly appreciate your replies. Feel much more settled now.
@AmericanAir I need to be back in Cleveland as early as possible tomorrow
@united it was eventually explained that weather conditions too extreme to get luggage off planes. Will be sent on. But I won't be for days!
@USAirways following you now
@united no tag number. Luggage was taken off the weigh scale and appears to have been sent off on conveyor belt without any tag...
@USAirways you are cutting into my pregame time.  Go @KentuckyMBB !!!!
@SouthwestAir WIFI is so slow it totally precludes working on the web. Will NOT book SWA for business travel. Wish I hadn't lit $24 on fire
@USAirways now siting on Tarmac in philly for another 15 minutes. This is so lame. Sorry doesn't help. This is terrible.
@USAirways  you took the miles out of my account and told me that I could restore by paying $150 or opening a credit card
@USAirways lack of communication with other offices, the customer, &amp; yall never update ur systems. U guys are 2 established 4 this mess
@SouthwestAir you Cancelled Flightled my flight and now I am in the back of the queue and you want to charge me 200  for business class? Stay classy
@SouthwestAir 4467 and 152 on 2/25 and 503 and 25 on 2/26th.
@USAirways I've been on hold for over 2 1/2 hours - there has to be an easier way to Cancelled Flight/get a refund... 😑😩 http://t.co/Cm4roIypc2
@SouthwestAir thankyou :))❤️
@united currently crying... I wanted to ski tomorrow but prolly not. Just a boy tryna fulfill his dreams
@SouthwestAir thank you, someone finally answered and was able to change my flight that was Cancelled Flighted bc of ice. Thank you for response
@SouthwestAir @love_dragonss LAUREN IM SCREAMING
@VirginAmerica How do I reschedule my Cancelled Flightled flights online? The change button is greyed out!
@united your service sucks to Mexico from houston. You finally realized that snacks in1st don't work you cheap as);:
@united flight UA5631 from SFO to Burbank has been delayed twice now. Still no plane in sight. Get it together.
@JetBlue I hope so. Wanted an early flight to avoid the airport chaos but it's too Late Flight for that!
@USAirways IT HAS BEEN FOUND THANK YOU
@SouthwestAir alas, it was pretty full so we had to entertain ourselves with witty repartee ...
@USAirways sucks. Delayed my mom's flight 2X, Cancelled Flightled it, delayed her flight again today,all for mech. issues.She had 2 sleep in airport!
@USAirways I really appreciate there not being an easy way to get another flight when mine has been delayed over 2hrs for mechanical reasons
@USAirways how does it feel to have almost everyone hate you?
@SouthwestAir 8 mins!!! http://t.co/bbZiJWFDL3
@united I am trying to book awards for September and need flights on @aegeanairlines but they will not show even w/ many award seats availab
@United. What's going on with UA 236?  outbound flight last thurs was delayed 4hrs How long will this delay be? #worst2unitedflightsever
@JetBlue here's part: was at bag drop inserted my JetBlue cc, didn't print pass. Agent standing in front of me refused to print my pass
@AmericanAir you expect us to spend our hard earn $ to fly and make exceptions when you have extra call volume, however, you never make acpt
I was a bit steamed in conjunction w/my new 7-hour wait at first, but having sat down and bought a bit of tea, I've settled some @JetBlue
@USAirways on top or having to check my bag I had to wait over 30 min for my bag to come out at baggage claim. Thanks for wasting my time
@USAirways sorry doesn't help.  It's midnight PST.  How in the hell am I still on hold after 90 minutes on customer service line?
@united your customer service is lacking and you owe me a @GoPro camera. I also appreciate not being interrupted every time I speak Thanks
@JetBlue doesn't help if I have to fly on specific days
@JetBlue Gnight checked in at POS &amp; supervisor was unaware of policy. That sucked having to guide him to the internet. He was v unfriendly
@JetBlue everyone is overreacting. Keep up your swag!
@usairways would it kill you to let me know how many minutes I might be on hold?
@americanair thanks to your airline I now have a ruined bag and you refuse to do anything about it.
@united flight Cancelled Flightled,  and the updated one gets me into BWI too Late Flight! I'd be fine with DCA or IAD,  just arriving earlier!  Help!
@USAirways any travel advisory coming for the Carolinas?  Bad weather!
@JetBlue order @FARE (3/3)
@SouthwestAir Is the 1,750 bonus at 1800Flowers still on or did it expire 2/14/15?
@united are there any upgrades avail to get us all on the same flight
@SouthwestAir i got the call from RDU that my baggage is there except that doesn't help me bc i can't get it until I'm flying back home.
@SouthwestAir how about #destinationdragon tix for tonite for the inconvenience since I am not there to play scavenger hunt?
@SouthwestAir left behind iPad Air on flight 505 from Bradley to BWI, plane had already left by the time I realized. Can you possibly help?
@SouthwestAir wow! Some things are better forgotten!
@united No, I do not. I was only given a Flight Booking Problems reference number.
@USAirways after 5 flight Cancelled Flightlations we finally get a flight, get to the gate on time &amp; you've given our seats away? Seriously??
@united good fly!! #United #businessFirst
@JetBlue @KyleJudah be responsible for replacing it
@united of course. But interesting how United doesn't seem to have a good sense on what's happening with flight
Happy #TT to my friends @AmericanAir . Hope the weather isn't causing you too many headaches.
@AmericanAir @sweetmel If weather is bad, wouldn't your folks try extra hard to communicate...or load bags onto flight 1320...or...anything?
@USAirways flight #3739 leaving CVG. Gate agent had no computer and counted passengers on paper. I feel safe.
@AmericanAir My reservation is on hold, not me.  Wish I was on hold but that's not possible with the phone issues at #americanair
@AmericanAir So plot thickens. We're on plane but no ground crew to get us off gate. Apparently under the weather in large numbers....
“@united: @ItsAaronChriz Sorry to hear about your flight. Do you need help reFlight Booking Problems?”👎
@VirginAmerica can't check in, your site looks like this every time it loads http://t.co/kAcY2AwDbW
@USAirways I made the change online, but couldn't check-in online, so had to call (3 hrs on hold btw). Shouldn't have been charged $25
@SouthwestAir how much is ur wifi fam
@JetBlue ill call in the morning. too upset right now.
@united after 6 hour plus delay from #WashingtonDC finally on flight to #Edinburgh all very tired
@AmericanAir That what I hoped - contacted them 3 wks ago about this but they have not responded and still issued in US funds. #frustrated
@USAirways I have never been given a number for elite for usair. Only AA. I waited for 3 hours for an answer and by then my seat was gone.
@united My flight was Cancelled Flighted and I'm needing some help reFlight Booking Problems.
@JetBlue Thanks, it's for next weekend though so my guess is it will only go higher.
@USAirways I’m still disappointed that it is apparently ok for a Flight Attendant who isn’t up on current policy to argue with a traveler.
@USAirways ok...i know doors close ~10 minutes before takeoff. stop telling me my flight will leave in 20 minutes when we haven't boarded.
@AmericanAir so you fail again flight to rdu sitting waiting on flight attendants. your logistics are not good
@VirginAmerica to jump into the #Dallas #Austin market http://t.co/SzR0pioA21
@AmericanAir To announce DURING BOARDING that you chose to limit catering to the point that you WILL run out shows a lack of planning, IMO.
@JetBlue How do I know if my flight was deemed a dark flight?
@USAirways I have been I hold for 40 min. My 5:50 flight just got Cancelled Flightled and rescheduled for Monday. This is unacceptable!
@JetBlue Will do. Thanks!
@USAirways can we hold two seats for 11:35 flight from PHX to Las 1856 as this delayed flight 556 is not going to arrive on-time
@AmericanAir Checked in on app since yesterday. Confirmed upgrade &amp; carry on, got to counter &amp; manager upgraded somebody else on my seat!
@SouthwestAir Teyana Taylor Performing #MedusaFridays 2.27 Free Till11 http://t.co/qwFMoQ0dQl http://t.co/kbb0B5FxMK #TheMenOfBusiness
@USAirways I have been in contact with 3 people and still no answers. You keep sending me to @Expedia and they keep sending me to you!
@AmericanAir I responded. Your info different than your customer service line
@JetBlue w/ edits: Dear @msbgu , your MBAs need better benefits. They should work for us. How can we meet them?
@united I flew United last month and the experience was AWESOME!
@united I would like to know what is the easiest way to get a refund.
@SouthwestAir customer service at FLL, BWI,and PIT have been terrible.no one knows where his bags are.his is on a job with no clothes &amp; gear
@USAirways Melinda in reservations in greensboro nc is an absolute jewel thank her for me she's amazing!!!
@SouthwestAir Maybe it is just a machine...
@USAirways First the pilot was Late Flight, now it's maintenance. This is EXACTLY what happened two weeks ago. Unacceptable.
@SouthwestAir Are you announcing any more winners to the #DestinationDragons @Imaginedragons  show @VelourLive in UTAH this weekend? #Lucky
@JetBlue okay. The new screens are laptop-large &amp; real nice &amp; the wifi is appreciated. Thanks god for this tiny lil man in the middle seat.
@AmericanAir I was just called abt my flight Cancelled Flightlation- a flight that was Cancelled Flightled at 10:30a Sunday. Two 4:00a calls are not okay.
@JetBlue are you my friend?!
@JetBlue I would drive 2 1/2 hours to jfk to board JetBlue to Vegas instead of closer Hartford airport. Cramming more seats on plane.NO MORE
@AmericanAir they responded. I can't respond to their response. Nor can I speak with someone. #worstcustomerserviceever
@USAirways Can't stress enough how awful the agent was for flight 5283. Knew 11 ppl from delayed flight were on way in mins, no compassion.
@USAirways stuck on Tarmac for hour an a half and told longer to go and no hotels available when we land in Phoenix #unacceptable #unhappy
@AmericanAir thank you
@united - with airport self checkin your only option I'm now your employee. Training was a bitch. Send my paycheck asap.
@VirginAmerica heyyyy guyyyys.. been trying to get through for an hour. can someone call me please? :/
“@AmericanAir: @mwangbickler We apologize for your frustrations, Michael. Have you been rebooked?” -got call back after 10 hours. Bad.
@SouthwestAir flight # 317
@JetBlue dispatcher keeps yelling and hung up on me!
@USAirways they said because there was no meal on my flight they would not - what airline serves food anymore? Update in policy?
@united mechanical delay occurred in Houston earlier today re: their flight to ORD
@SouthwestAir Are we sure flights will not be Cancelled Flighted after 1200 I am trying to make plans in STL
They didnt just tweet this... Nah. RT “@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/1yLn1Gx4QX”
@SouthwestAir most other carriers were flying out way past SW Cancelled Flightlation. @AlaskaAir and @JetBlue got their passengers out much Late Flightr!!!!!
@united on the plane. I was thoughtful enough to ask for it and got it; there are prob others that also deserved it
@SouthwestAir DeLacy P is a compassionate professional! Despite the flight challenges she made passengers feel like priorities!!🌟🌟
@USAirways Thanks for Cancelled Flighting my flight tomorrow and not reFlight Booking Problems me on another one. #usairwaysfail
@VirginAmerica would love to do more for virgin just like I do for @GoPro
@united  very disappointed by the service starting from gate operator at BOS , who was  rude in stopping a carry-on bag...
@JetBlue I don't think I'll be testing those waters out on my own dime again.
@united @PGATOUR @NTrustOpen Next thing you know, United will believe they are above the DOT and take them to court. United is anti-consumer
@USAirways Has To Be THE WORST Airline Of All Time😡😡😡
@AmericanAir Here you go https://t.co/oM1vIEg74a
@JetBlue We already won the tickets but she's totally on a beach right now. #flightlanding #sunscreen #feelsgood http://t.co/5PvG2hJXKp
@USAirways sitting on the Tarmac waiting to deplane 40+ minutes. The level of service I've come to expect.
@USAirways you see now that is a lie.  They auto respond with insulting email. #sucks
@SouthwestAir is awful. They have lost my bag and aren't providing any info. This is day 3 and nothing. #WORSTAIRLINEEVER
@united my partner and I booked individual reservations for same flight. I have Pr. Silver -- can he share my premier privileges somehow?
@VirginAmerica partners with @Visa Checkout as mobile payment method to help boost mobile conversion rates #etailwest #payments #visa
@JetBlue  I see my flight from Boston to Pitts is ok from this afternoon. Did you have any delays for the morning flight?
@AmericanAir when the pilot announces that the plane has been unused for 2 days and maintenance is dealing with another aircraft..
@SouthwestAir how do I find travel funds I have available to use f/ past changed flights? don't see an option in my account.
@united hi I left my asus tablet on flight to Heathrow from Newark on 16th feb and wondered how long it takes for someone to check if found?
@united this is despicable I spoke to  many diff people &amp; everyone is telling me something different I have a claim no. I need my bag now
@united I sure did.   I had to drive a total of 3 hours to get my own bag.  I'd like to explain that debacle but no one wants to talk to me.
@united Flight 472 from ORD couldn't let me know about this? Found out via app minutes before landing. Awful flight. http://t.co/DQJl8vZ2h2
@united thnx
@united followed &amp; DM'd.
@SouthwestAir MY BAGS ARE. 1st woman said it would be there on the next flight... not there, so now Ive got nothing. Big wigs help me out
@united she's the type of person that can make a customers day! I fly 100+ times a year &amp; she's one of the top flight attendants I've had!
@united probably wouldn't be doing it had someone returned my call or email. Case number 8273993
@united Has it departed? I was awaiting an inbound plane yesterday for three hours and it never arrived. Had to stay overnight (again).
@united thanks finally made it.. Missed meetings but what can I do now?
@JetBlue by any chance do u offer fresh guacamole on your flights
@united UA5396 can wait for me. I'm on the ground trying to get to the gate after we were moved to B. This is crap.
@united is the stingiest airline. Nobody should model after them. #PTFO #cheap #bastards #stingy
“@AmericanAir:  "Jason, you'll end up missing your connection. Please see our DFW agents for assistance.” Nope! Hasn't taken off yet, still!
@SouthwestAir I have been in contact and know there are changes but it's a destination you should really evaluate! Thanks
@united When my United flight arrives Late Flight and I'm told to re-book my connecting United flight, you characterize that as a "no show"
@SouthwestAir 2nd leg of trip Cancelled Flightled. Been on hold 1.5 hrs. Will we lose our $ if we don't speak to someone before first flight leaves?
@JetBlue while I appreciate that you actually responded I travel way too much for you to tell me coffee is not a basic option
@SouthwestAir i live in the southwest, Imagine Dragons is my favorite band, and i met my 2bestfriends thanks to them. it would be amazing +
@AmericanAir fcuk you. Shit service. You got no fans.
@AmericanAir AA1675 flight out of Jamaica was Cancelled Flightled yesterday due to "weather", while other flights were still landing at DFW
@USAirways can I bring a copy or photo of my baby's birth certificate for the flight? I feel uncomfortable traveling with the real thing.
@AmericanAir u r horrible.went online to Cancelled Flight flight-no button-4that.Called CS &amp;wait time 40 mins&amp;put in my #.800#called&amp;it hungupNOHELP
@AmericanAir my wife's flight is Cancelled Flightled, told to call. No one answers. How do we book a flight? Help us please
@united as u might imagine, this former pilot was particularly touched by the gesture. Please let the FO know #keepingtraditionsalive
@AmericanAir I have "continued contacting" your phone reps for 7 hours and am still unable to get through. That's absurd and I am livid.
@united From the air: Another missed cnxn 2day. ATC went on strike in Belize this AM. Now family &amp; I miss cnxn in EWR. Please see my DMs.
@united Waiting half an hour for my checked bag at EWR (&amp; that was Priority); disappointing, usually you guys are good.
@VirginAmerica This is what you missed @NewsVP. Next trip to the 407.
@USAirways 24 hrs Late Flightr still not home. Hotel, rental car etc with a 5 yr old, what happened to "customer service is our first priority"
@united on #UA3785 tonight and told delayed due to Late Flight crew. No idea where crew coming from, your staff ++unhelpful. Any ideas?
@SouthwestAir if this flight is Cancelled Flighted or delayed any further I expect full compensation for my park ticket, hotel &amp; flight..
@united it was me who had the problem won flight ua 1580. I called and rebooked myself found my own hotel and taxi
@SouthwestAir yes please!
@JetBlue u the real MVP http://t.co/jWL26G6lRw
@usairways missed flight connection due to flight attendant delay. Yet no voucher on your part? #fail
@SouthwestAir I think that flight was supposed to go to Houston as well, in case someone could check that?
@united I was patient when they refused to switch my flight Bc of my checked bag then Cancelled Flightled the one I was on
@SouthwestAir I continue to be amazed by the amazing customer service.  Thank you SWA!
@SouthwestAir to start 2xdaily #B737-700 flights from #Columbus OH to #Boston @BostonLogan on 8AUG #avgeek
@united, UA1641 EWR-MCO 17 Feb wifi never connected but allowed me to purchase access twice &amp; charged me. Who do I need to file claim with?
@JetBlue ...and when did your legal department start running your social media channels?
@united trying to check in for tomorrow's flight. website keeps timing out. what's up?
@AmericanAir @ti2469 oh shiz i'm only 40 minutes into my wait after the first 3 hour barrier ...unbelievable
@USAirways who do I contact about my awful experience I had 2/15/15 with @USAirways Flight 713 BUF-CLT?
@AmericanAir @sa_craig no, not helped one bit. actually ended up driving home due to extreme disorganization and lack of communication.
@AmericanAir spent hour+ trying to check after to use military ID for luggage then messed up boarding pass &amp; forced into line again.
@JetBlue or she ;)
@AmericanAir been a very long day in Philly...12:13pm flt to ORD Cancelled Flighted with NO notice, no message, no email.  NOT NICE FOR WE PLATINUMS.
@CatfoodBeerGlue you'll enjoy this. “@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/2thC9RKURT”
@USAirways I'm dumping this dividend miles card and forgetting your airline exists #ridiculous #theworstairlineever
@VirginAmerica can u help this 👸 @FreyaBevan_Fund needs urgent treatment in🇺🇸2y old battling cancer could u help with flights 💗#freyasfund
@VirginAmerica thanks for gate checking my baggage on your full flight dfw-lax 883 and giving me early boarding too #sweet
@united such a relaxing space for a drink before my flight! (at @United Global First Lounge) https://t.co/j4cj0lrF2d http://t.co/dTLGUQ1kAk
@USAirways me too. In the future, have a better harsh weather preparedness plan. So much of your staff called out that everything snowballed
@USAirways I’ve been on hold for 36 minutes now, any time you want to answer the phone that would be great.
@JetBlue You mean take more of my time to write you a physical letter because the fraud department doesn't have email or telephones. Right?
@united is a money sucking airline with terrible terrible customer service
Thank you for your help, Shannon! Great customer service, @SouthwestAir.
@AmericanAir Don't require us to memorize a five-word phrase and remember it after we hear another six million options
@USAirways @Beamske how about a real live person talk to the person whose luggage was lost for 4 days and vacation wrecked . @yorkshire2002
@SouthwestAir its all good. flight eventually took off, and landed safely. oh, and I got the free cup o wine. thx
@SouthwestAir I did. Thank you.
@SouthwestAir is it possible to book a refundable trip? Willing to pay extra. This would be for a domestic round trip flight
@united Friend stuck in bus on runway at PEK with two small kids no customer service, no explanation, kids crying, awful service.
RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/826Pkiq5HI
@AmericanAir are you ignoring me on purpose? It was sad enough having your automated system hang up on me 😭
@SouthwestAir I changed my flight through St. Louis. Thanks for the reply though!
*On the brink of bankruptcy. “@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/01ldxn3QqQ”
@AmericanAir My pleasure, next AA flight - this Wednesday to Milan, Italy for @MIDOExhibition -- See you then! :)
@united: "Left gate 5 minutes early." My thoughts: "That doesn't count if you sit on the Tarmac for a half hour." #comeonpeople
@united just like clockwork, Friday afternoon flights from LAS to DEN running Late Flight. Why does this seem to happen so consistently #KeepIt100
@AmericanAir they will just say dumb things to beat around the bush ! If you're flight Cancelled Flightled be prepared for no compassion from them
@united Delayed more and more these days. MCO &gt; IAD. Fingers crossed I make my connection home to Albany. #united1K
@usairways can I get assistance on flight #611? Plane just landed from HPN and I have a connection to ATL.
@SouthwestAir thanks!
@united 1591 had wi-fi broken on plane. Had same outage on 1618 on Friday. How can Southwest get it right on every plane but United can't?
@AmericanAir Sorry that is a sad answer a fully refundable first fare and no response in 6 weeks ! No more AA in my future !
@VirginAmerica your inflight team makes the experience #amazing!
@SouthwestAir Me on one of your planes!!! Thanks for taking me Arizona 184! http://t.co/Finq5Fh6ue
@SouthwestAir are 5 people there?
@JetBlue can you give me an update on flight 1684 MCO-&gt;JFK? They're saying mechanical issues but will not disclose what they are...
@AmericanAir two Cancelled Flightled LGA flights. Both by @Delta took off. Looks like I have a new carrier @Delta!
@united Disappointed,UNITED did NOT feed small CHILDREN on a 5 &amp; half hour flight (Honolulu to Los Angeles), Appalling, ESP food waspaid for
@USAirways so upset with customer service. I have a simple question and the phone system has disconnected me all day today and yesterday.
@VirginAmerica Your website is down and I'm trying to check in!
@JetBlue, thanks for not guarantee that you can not deli ever my bags to my hotel, when bag missed connection. #sFO #customerservicenot
@USAirways That is the height of rudeness, and without question the worst customer service I have ever experienced.
@united I have received one previously on the 11th having checked. Odd as you said there was no complaint associated with my e-mail?
@JetBlue I'm not sure if you can do anything to help me with that, but if you can that'd be great.
@USAirways Official time of call 3 hours 10 minutes but must add for 7 minutes your reservation agent was extremely professional and helpful
@United Airlines Cancelled Flights OC FLL #flight today. $700 to switch. No notice no apology. We are done flying #UnitedAirlines.
@USAirways i got through and am able to switch my flight with no charge. Thank you
@JetBlue your wifi is a lie and i hate you
@JetBlue good luck. Thanks.
@USAirways YOU ARE THE BEST!!! FOLLOW ME PLEASE;)🙏🙏🙏✌️✌️✌️🙏🙏🙏
@SouthwestAir not letting me DM. # is FSZ4YO
@USAirways I already HAVE, four times
@USAirways now the 3rd issue with the plane is a fuel leak. They will let us know soon what they decide. #getmeoffthisplane #ineedabeer
@USAirways Bag policy says stroller OR car seat.  We need to bring 2 car seats and 1 stroller.  Should I just call for details?
@AmericanAir after all that weve been through today as a courtesy to not allow a passenger with an oxgen tank sit up there is bad business
@USAirways Looking forward to some friends and family time in Arizona.
@AmericanAir oh, yeah. I guess those are two different things. 3 am does weird things to my brain. Thanks again! xox
@USAirways this is the worst customer service I have ever had. Rebooked to tues but seat available on mon. Wtf. Contact me.
@AmericanAir @NY_NJairports AA1224: 45 mins for Priority bags to arrive, now Late Flight for evening plans! Delta 20 min bag guarantee anyone? :(
@united 15-hr flight w/broken #Dreamliner media system. Witness #mental #breakdown as we bounce off walls. Remind me why I'm 1K.
“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/JMnkJ6Bmc2” Jet Blizzue in the hizouse.
Sorry for unfollowing, @JetBlue
@USAirways Already planning my local boycott for Washington, D.C. Area.
@AmericanAir #AmericanAirlines 1 1/2 hr wait for bags. If this is the a taste of the worlds largest airline, heaven help aviation
@USAirways You have Cancelled Flighted our flights 5 times over the past 3 days...and the experience has been the worst...never again...
@united ok. I just submitted. Thanks for the opportunity to give feedback.
@united Lisa J is amazing the guy not so much.
@SouthwestAir cool the plane you said is ours that just left the terminal for a diff city? She a cold betch for "flying the friendly skies"
HA! “@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/zQuTUS7epW”
@USAirways @AmericanAir seriously with all the service issues you are having right now this is what you decide to tweet?? Unbelievable
@AmericanAir Was put on hold for 5.5 hrs then got a call back at 11:20 pm, only to wait on hold for another hour.
@JetBlue great to see the RedSox plane and your reminder you ❤️NY side by side at JFK #catsanddogslivingtogether http://t.co/KFUyYoKUFv
@SouthwestAir my flight continues through to Vegas after my stop. Don't be upset if a stowaway.
@USAirways after last night in Charlotte NC I'm seriously debating never flying you again. 50 minute on the Tarmac, connection leaves.
@united is your check-in system down? I'm having trouble checking in for a flight that departs in less than 24 hrs.
@JetBlue woulda been nice of you to let us know that or post it!!! Your boards still show the flight on time!!!
@USAirways been trying for weeks no use
@USAirways has an SPF record error that is causing e-mail from noreply@usairwaysmobile.com to go to spam filters. DNS admin needs to fix!
@JetBlue Ricoh Smith at BOS provided oust and service
@JetBlue Hi. How do I claim points on a 1800-flowers order after I purchased? I totally forgot to put in the promo code.
@united any solutions?
@AmericanAir Nice AA employee making skillful excuses about Late Flightness due to catering snafu... http://t.co/YPVPVdlTYs
@usairways sadly they've tried that and airport agents…no flights so they're stranded at PHL. No chance of a hotel for them?
@USAirways gate agent in CLT forced me to check bag in z1 &amp; proceeded to allow larger bags. Huge inconvenience to travel plans.
@USAirways Thank you. The website crashing for me.
@USAirways @franchise02 my friend has been on hold for 1.5 hours and still counting!
@AmericanAir yep as I saidi feel sorry for you that you have to run their account how embarrassing for you
@united Just checking in again - what is the status of our claim.   It is going on 2 months with no attention to this?   We are very upset.
@SouthwestAir inflight entertainment.  Tonight a Willie Nelson impersonator sang for the passengers #peanutsandtoons http://t.co/kCDdOD7uFF
@JetBlue Not helping since there's a bunch of us trying to get off at the same time.
@AmericanAir I've been calling your 1800 # all morning to change my name for an upcoming trip but am not able to get through. Please advise!
@United Wonder why people hate dealing with airlines?  Ridiculous and inflexible "policies".  I need a phone number and a resolution.  Now.
@VirginAmerica I need a receipt for a flight change. Can you send one?
@AmericanAir next time my flight's Cancelled Flightled, I'd appreciate SOME indication (email, text, carrier pigeon). App didn't even warn at check in
@united no way one person is working entire security checkpoint in EWR 🆖
@SouthwestAir sat on a plane for 2+ hrs on 2/15! Then we finally took off.. :(
@SouthwestAir Thanks for the response. Was able to get my situation resolved. Not a fan of Mother Nature today. :)
@JetBlue Phew!! Did it!! (Pant. Wheeze) http://t.co/ZPZ78POeON
Bruh “@VirginAmerica: @giannilee Turn down for what. #VXSafetyDance”
@AmericanAir Hello ! I cannot register for my tomorrow flight from Paris to Las Vegas "This feature is currently unavailable" appears ?
@USAirways spent 1.5 hours in line trying to get on a flight home tonight only for it to be Cancelled Flightled an hour Late Flightr. Not even snowing at DCA
@AmericanAir Lady at B1 ABQ for 5347 on 2/23 was of a great service to all among several Cancelled Flightlations
@united UA647 heading back to gate bc improper load? if ur packing us to the gills should at least take care to load bags. expecting comp...
@united define "appreciate". I doubt the worst major airline in the USA acts on much feedback.
@united Great!  I'm guessing you were Late Flight to open, service is horrible, you're overcharging, and don't care that everyone is miserable.
@SouthwestAir Hi! I ❤️ your company and fly all the time. I was wondering if you could please share this link &amp; read! http://t.co/lO6LghPcdU
Hey @united, this is your job, don't give me the safety spin. This is the same plane that broke on the original flight out. #unitedSucks
.@JetBlue yes. Filed a claim and they issued $30 credit as a courtesy. The whole thing seems exceptionally uncourteous to me.
@AmericanAir hey flight 5350 in dfw stuck at gate with no gate agent.  Plane full of people missing connections.
@SouthwestAir okay just signed up!
@SouthwestAir Been on hold for over an hour - any chance someone can help me on here?
@united  found a group of people who actually hates people more than ISIS, thats right United Airlines.
@AmericanAir  800 number will not even let you wait for next customer rep. Very frustrating. Can't talk to humans.
@SouthwestAir Again, please accept my apologies for my lame, childish tweet. You didn't deserve that, &amp; I remain a LOYAL SW customer!
@JetBlue flight attendant Wendi on Flt 127 on 2/17, Newark to Orlando.  👍👍
@united I'll be impressed if I actually get a response! 😜
@AmericanAir 45min wait to get de-iced in Tulsa.Not good service.Looks like everyone will miss connections, not due to weather. Fight is on
RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/WEZUMDimYF
@JetBlue If your confirming to me that the rate won't go down again looks like I can't fly JetBlue this time around, can't afford that price
@JetBlue OK cool.  I need to listen to some Dre and Snoop en route to LA.  That would have been a shame.
@JetBlue shocker my flight delayed an hour. Thanks for reminding me why I switched to delta.
@JetBlue received a voucher but if you want to improve relations be up front with passengers.
@USAirways #Overbooked SXM-CLT delayed deplaning extra passengers. #missedconnection #forcedovernight #CLT, no lodging/food. Disappointed.
@JetBlue Awesome thanks! Thanks for the quick response. You guys ROCK! :)
@AmericanAir Of course you are because that's your companies job! You guys failed at it in the first place. Upgrade me and then we'll talk.
@united we have tried to change our flight THREE times on the phone and got disconnected each time.
@SouthwestAir When will the flight resume? I don's see it in the open schedule. :/
Who did this?!?!“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/kHZrCCyp2A”
@united  i have a weekend of dealing with your company that would say otherwise.
@united why haven't you updated that flight 4411 is delayed? Super frustrating
@SouthwestAir @DreSparkles Thank you! I finally made it to my destination
@JetBlue flight 790 you had us stuck on the plane for nearly 4 hrs. Set to take off only for flight control to deny us. THE WORST SERVICE
@united trying to book flight w/miles. Was on hold for 50m before I gave up. Need to get 6 on same flight using two diff # and pay 4 1tix
@SouthwestAir why did I not receive drink coupons with 65,000 points? But all my friends did?
😢😢 RT“@JetBlue: @Peaches275 Oh no! Unfortunately, the code must be entered at the time of purchase in order to qualify for the points.”
@AmericanAir my wife was on a flt from BRO to TUL via DFW that was Cancelled Flighted. Bought an SWA flight to get her home. Partial refund,DM me plz?
@JetBlue I do! The best airline wifi ever. Thank you!
@AmericanAir I've got a BA flight as your airport couldn't accommodate us. We were left without any info. No vouchers for food,nothing.
@JetBlue Of course U know I would like 2 lay you down in a #BedofRoses as long as they're #mint colored! https://t.co/3QYEzHjGsb #brandmance
@USAirways have checked all day.  CHO needs added.  Please evaluate.
@united, I booked our flights w/ @WestJet. I saw the same prices each time I searched. It wasn't the least bit frustrating. #customerservice
@VirginAmerica @ladygaga @carrieunderwood Julie Andrews all the way though @ladygaga was very impressive! NO to @Carrieunderwood
@AmericanAir now I have to pay for a hotel a car ride miss classes which I pay 30k for and miss work and you tell me to talk to someone

@AmericanAir @ArminRosen @ggreenwald Tell that piece of shit to get fucked... I'll fly exclusively with you for life...
@AmericanAir stuck at gate Miami to JFK flight 1510. Are we going to get out of here tonight? Very frustrating
@united time to give up my 1K status and switch to @Delta - you are so terrible I can't even describe.
@AmericanAir Agents in DFW were very kind did their best to help, but this doesn't make up for PHX error and attitude! #Americant
@united this is nuts they said a flight was on the ground now it's still in Albany and they won't have a plane.  Someone is compensating me
@united download jeokoo the American app for air travelers
@USAirways @ClaudOakeshott how about a link that works pls Nothing but complete frustration w usair last 12 hrs
@united my luggage is set to go to DCA however, I am rerouted to Dulles. Currently in NOLO however bags are in Houston. Can you fix this?
@AmericanAir Am I upgraded on my next flight?
@JetBlue Good perspective. If only this safety concern had been expressed at some point before I arrived at the airport. #communicationiskey
@united does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter
@united I trust you enough to put my coat in my checked bag!
@USAirways what does "your reservation is 'out of sync.'" mean? On hold w customer service 12 min and want an idea what is up
@JetBlue why, when you book a flight now, does jetblue separate a 3yr old from the mother? Isn't that a bit stupid? check-in headaches!
@united help me, united! I paid for economy plus on a flight that was changed BC of delay. Will I be automatically refunded?
@USAirways Cant help but be frustrated after an hour call with u ends up with a disconnection and no answers especially as div pref member.
@united You delayed a connection for customer service today now I'll be able to pay my final respects to a dear family member. Thank you :)
@united @ehsanisMpowered lmfao
@united two service agents hung up on me the third was able to get me a flight on US air today. Three calls and 2.5 hours to get a flight
@SouthwestAir @SouthwestOliver that's a great FA right there.
@AmericanAir Thanks - I note some, but not all, flights are Cancelled Flightled - are only some aircraft/runways working out of DFW today/tomorrow?
@USAirways do you have an email??
@AmericanAir delta rerouted 6 of my bags onto aa977 MIA-CUR. How can I see if they made it onto the flight?
@AmericanAir we are waiting flight 919 !We are at JFK for about 24h !! #NewYork #919 #viracopos #AmericanAirlines http://t.co/3FheS0lPMU

@SouthwestAir  I have a flight 2/22 @930 am from Fort Lauderdale to bwi.. Can I Cancelled Flight that flight ? Flight 3458 trip I'd 314505529

@JetBlue other jfk to Boston flights went off with some delay but not this.  #epicfail
@VirginAmerica OMG FINALLY
@AmericanAir thank you for the assistance
@JetBlue Disappointed we weren't allowed to bring on an aircraft approved carseat on an empty plane. Not cool.
@AmericanAir That will be the third time I have been called by 800-433-7300 an hung on before anyone speaks. What do I do now???
@united like continental's chicken feat fairs
@VirginAmerica is your website ever coming back online?
@USAirways it still says that I can't check into my flight because the information is incorrect but everything is entered correctly
@JetBlue sent :-) curious to see what kind of comp we get.
@united well for a start it would be nice if your ticket was actually in the system when you change a flight
Too Late Flight. RT “@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/nJ5Ga1gds5”
@AmericanAir If it's in my backpack, why do I need to see agent?
@united Hey, thanks again for helping me miss my buddies 30th bday, you guys are really a trashy company #shouldhaveflowndelta #unitedsucks
@JetBlue thanks so much!! ❤️✨ very relaxing flight!
@AmericanAir is terrible, my flights Cancelled Flighted and i've been on hold for the past 4 hours. Never again.
@JetBlue Left my coat on flight 453 this morning in overhead bin.  Reported seat 12A, but I was 11A.  Thx.  Ticket 2792125083854
@USAirways thanks for nothing. Bought two tix through you to Disney and my friend can't go and now I have to eat the 400, plus 600 for new 1
@AmericanAir what's the status of flight 3494 XNA to DFW. I'm getting different reports?
@AmericanAir That's good, I'd expect that but I can't get through on the phone to make any changes. Can I change it online?
@SouthwestAir The Opal Dragon book The Dragon (ALI) has woven his murdering ways from the Philippines to Australia http://t.co/c9p2ioSphM
@SouthwestAir stuck in NYC flights Cancelled Flightled 2 days in a row Long wait times on phones. Running out of $ but SWA no help
@JetBlue Cancelled Flighted 😢
@united your helpful agents in Club helped.  I am just out baggage fees and a night of my life.stop doing business with @SilverAirways
@united why would a person take hours and hours of wait time just to tell a lie
@united I was well taken care of, thanks. I've already been sent a survey request &amp; I'll share my positive experience (despite delay)
@united Ice, which I totally understand. But when a large number of us are facing 15+ hours of time and overnight Cancelled Flightations it seems like
@JetBlue our flight out no Tv. Now our flight back not seated together. B6 620. Maybe our fault still no fun.
@VirginAmerica I'm #elevategold for a good reason: you rock!!
@USAirways Still irritated that our well planned and booked return was messed with &amp; with no warning.
@AmericanAir Have been trying to reach American Airlines since last evening to Cancelled Flight flights. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! What now???
@united why are your agents working so slowly to rebook people who are on #UA1481. We have all wasted an entire day at STT.
@VirginAmerica, you're doing a great job adding little luxuries/aesthetics that improve the air travel experience. Thank you. Keep it up!
@USAirways flt last nght Cancelled Flighted-mech.probs, flt this am Cancelled Flighted-snow, finally on a flt home. 1st cls empty &amp; they won't let me sit there
@AmericanAir - I'd be happy to hold on the phone, but your phone system is not allowing that and simply hangs up.
@USAirways Round Two of being THE worst airline ever.
@USAirways Not a great experience for my first time flying US Airways. Going forward I'll probably be taking my business elsewhere.
@SouthwestAir you're giving everyone tix for #DestinationDragons except for me and it's during my birthday!!!!
@united Heads up We didn't check 8 bags, 2 we checked arrived, those aren't claim #s for our 2. Other people's bags? http://t.co/dplQ3mhQGD
@JetBlue thanks. I will use the extra time to do some more shopping! Did somebody say duty free?
@AmericanAir All of the nicest people in the world work at Admiral's clubs. Gladys in San Juan es mi Amiga
@SouthwestAir Deborah helped me💁
@united spending the afternoon @ Mia. Not your fault.  No lounge? Very inconvenient.
@JetBlue I will when I land.
@JetBlue and have empty "help" desks
@united someone should send a note to the revenue management team and ask about all the open BF and GF seats on 919.
@United is an airline where you pay extra to get a better seat but by the time you board your overbooked flight, there's no overhead space.
@USAirways weather doesn't excuse poor customer service, lack of info from staff or the fact staff haven't turned up
@USAirways guys I need help my reservations, tried calling and I'm told to call Late Flightr. Please help me here.
@united you guys are horrible! First we get stuck in the snow for a hr in ewr now sitting in cmh saying it could be 30min for a gate
@united nope. Even better there were 4 seats. And due to W&amp;B first to raise hands got to move up. I wasn't fast enough.
I'd like the 11c I originally tried for @AmericanAir - again, happy to pay the difference
@USAirways your customer service is horrendous. Between the way employees speak customers and their lack of care for problems with flights.
@united Pick
@united did I win :)
@USAirways that's ok, just know that I'll most likely never book with you again
@SouthwestAir sure, please follow me so I can do so?
@united went to Customer Service kiosk and they were able to help out! Still thanks for following up!
@SouthwestAir i hope i can take my selfie stick on the plane today! #goingtovegas
@JetBlue If you have well-priced flights to #Oahu - we could be best friends. @vincenzolandino
@USAirways we will...sunday! Just a few days away
@JetBlue, your hold music sucks.
@united This isn't a one time thing either! It's a shocking pattern of repeated neglect and disrespect.
@united with the purchase of my ticket i am entitled to check in 1 bag however i am being charged an extra 25 dollars for domestic transport
@AmericanAir She told us we had to drive back to drop it off so they could attempt to fix it. Really? Don't have time to do that. #terrible
@JetBlue why don't you fly to #nashville? :(
“@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/cRFrwpc1Sx”😂😂😂
@AmericanAir followback
@united you would think you would clean your ramps. Our jet is stuck in the snow in Newark. This would never happen with @Delta
@SouthwestAir my wife is trying to get a group of clients to their destination and just got disconnected after2 hours holding. Help.
@AmericanAir You should be more timely with bags that missed a flight, people need their undies the next morning!
@AmericanAir really American Airlines , service is Las Vegas is shocking, absolute jokers take your reputation more seriously!
@AmericanAir cut it. Put me on a flt tomorrow.
@united thanks ^mr i got rebooked already but I lost my first class seat. Such is life.
@USAirways we bought our tickets months ago. Had seats together for all 6. Haven't changed flight. Now 4 kids seats are scattered on plane.
@JetBlue I digg it!
@united cs thinks that miles can repair the damage done, it will be interesting if they travel in @united and exp the worst flight ever!
@United Stars and Bars @iah #A320 @airlineguys @AirlineGeeks #avgeek http://t.co/mWSoGUC33p
@AmericanAir Oh, and losing my luggage #ridiculous # angrybird # where'smybag
@united Our vacation's going to be ruined w/ 3 days of rain. : ( The change fee for 2 of us is nearly cost of original flight. Can you help?
@united just curious, when are you going to to finally learn #customerservice ?
@USAirways 24 hrs of traveling and this just welcomes u back home to the US. 4 hr layover and I get to watch it going to wrong destination.
@AmericanAir thanks! I hope we get movies. Tv's were broke on the flight over
@AmericanAir  @SouthwestAir  — Y'all will like this one. http://t.co/hF8aJZ4ffl
@united Also your at-gate monitor showed 23 empty seats
@USAirways oh they saw it and said nothing.

@AmericanAir due to road conditions
@united I need to speak with a supervisor or someone who is #willing to help me use a credit I have ASAP.  #letsworktogether
@united thank you!

@VirginAmerica great. Well deserved.
@AmericanAir have your experts seen this? this is right at RDU airport. http://t.co/mPliO6DYgn
@JetBlue flt 136 from PHX. Delayed 2 hrs, circle 1 hr, divert to upstate NY, just sitting for 1 hr No communication #horrible
@united &amp; finally he was told he couldnt use the front of plane restrm (he was row7) though myself/others in rows behind him used w/no issue
@USAirways ANSWER THE BLOODY PHONE!
@united @staralliance how can I book reward travel in August?? Everything is blacked out.
@AmericanAir gate agent Jan L at Phoenix was at least able to get my younger daughter seated near my wife. Thank you!
@united I guess. But what is the excuse for understaffed costumer services? 3 people had to deal with lots of angry passengers. Weather too?
@USAirways needs to hire more people http://t.co/3LPVFhKy2F
@united flight 5187 to be specific. The last two were probably 30 feet apart and within sight of each other
@JetBlue nope. Currently sitting at my gate.
@JetBlue @NinaDavuluri 😃cool
@USAirways is setting themselves up for a lawsuit. No way we should sit on a plane for an hour and a half.
@united @estellevw does she need to complain on Twitter for the refund or is it auto-applied?
@AmericanAir flight 1388 tomorrow 5:15 am, status please, thanks
@JetBlue Hello we are doing a world record attempt on the amount of ball point pens in a collection please could you help with a pen?
@USAirways No I need the corporate office number please as that is who is dealing with this for me. It's a 480 number.
@USAirways waiting all day at ATL since flight this am Cancelled Flightled. 1 standby told no seats and group of 15 shows up Late Flight and gets on to PHL
@USAirways How about moving my seats to where I bought them 4 months ago? This happens far too often...
@AmericanAir got another flight. Thanks you
@SouthwestAir think flight 1945 from BNA to LAX will get off the ground tomorrow??? #please #snowbama
@USAirways is the worst airline I’ve ever flown on. You guys have treated me like garbage today.
@SouthwestAir #delayed again! You're killing me Late Flightly!
@United to start daily #B777-200ER flights from #Newark to #Milan #Malpensa replacing #B767-400ER on 7APR instead 28MAR #avgeek

@AmericanAir I'm flying into DCA my bag is at IAD.  I am already Late Flight for my meetings at work.  I will call the number when I land 😭
@SouthwestAir flt 3260 out of mht. Have fun with my kids and grandkids 10 of them!!  Jack says hi! http://t.co/BHOOiyT6ZQ

@JetBlue good morning sunshine! #TailfinThursday http://t.co/Nc0ES6e4Lf

@united any last minute flight deals for your cute little #frequentflyer ??? :)))) my Friday flight was Cancelled Flightled!!
@united Woke up to notification- flight moved 1.5 hrs early. Barely made flight then 3 hrs layover in SFO - wanted to hop on earlier option
@JetBlue some woman stole my seat on the plane but I was the one that had to sit elsewhere. Is that standard protocol?
@AmericanAir don't worry. I'll be sending a letter with what I expect from you for compensation. I fly twice a week w/you guys...for now
@AmericanAir Plane Veers Off Runway at Icy Dallas Airport http://t.co/DW6VDvqXBB
@SouthwestAir Thanks I get that. It looks like all BWI-SJD services stops after Aug 7. Is that the case? I cant find one date with flights.
@USAirways now on hold with customer care.  Wonder if someone will pick up the phone before 5pm.
@AmericanAir yes called your UK number on skype…well worth the $.50.  i recommend others do the same.
@united was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic
@JetBlue disappointed with the missed connection from ROC to SLC and no reimbursement even tho friend who is a pilot said it was due to ATC
@AmericanAir I'm sure they did. It's certainly chilly back East today! 😮
@United - flight Cancelled Flightled. 4 hrs at airport to book a new one for $95. Just got two invoices for the flight, each for approx $300. Really?!
@AmericanAir. Had my flight changed from US Airways to you, now I can't get two seats together. Can you help?
@united...do you still have flat tire policy.  Shuttle broke down on way to ORD.  Will probably miss the 425pm to CLE...Help please!!
@SouthwestAir never got any notification that flight 955 was Cancelled Flighted today. Correct phone # and email on file. Not a happy customer.
@AmericanAir 2days 2plains 2fails
@united more and more delays! No CS help at all! No notifications!
@AmericanAir Always love opening the upgrade email.
@united I forgot that Intl flights out of LAX don't go from Intl Terminal! Easiest re-check in ever! woo!
@USAirways your IVR hung up on me because of high call volume? I need help. Call me
@USAirways  you were always my go to. What happened?  Airbus over Boeing, and now no customer service?
@USAirways why didn't you reroute BOS to JAX via DCA through CLT instead forcing an overnight @DCA #passengersLose
@JetBlue can I switch my seat for my trip on Sunday?
@SouthwestAir Had a very unpleasant experience over the phone with one of your agents re: a Cancelled Flightled flight. I have the name &amp; agent ID.
@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine I always tell everyone to fly Southwest! Congratulations!!!
@JetBlue's CEO battles to appease passengers and Wall Street - Waterbury Republican American http://t.co/5fmipW9dhi
@AmericanAir You found my lost luggage, won't bring it to me until tomorrow. Next day if the weather isn't nicer. Terrible service
@united your agents (and service) on my weekend trip have been AMAZING!!! Thank you!!
@SouthwestAir Is it a temporary site glitch or are you no longer offering flights from GRR to GEG after Feb? Can't find any online :(
@USAirways customer service fail... Todays experience will ensure I do my best NEVER to utilize you again...
@USAirways they call weather an act of God and refuse to help. I have my wife and 3 kids and they have no sympathy.
@AmericanAir i dont believe it, it has been impossible for your agents to get an update from the delivery company since yesterday at 11 am
@united my golf bag didn't have a top cover + staffers said they couldn't check without a type of cover or wrap. Forced to leave the bag...
@JetBlue figured it out 4 flight 2morrow. Hard to believe with oil so low, and the killing u make that even part of a hotel can't be comp'd
@usairways yep, sent my bag to Philadelphia instead of Miami...I caught it...then was told my flight changed to tomorrow, wrong again #fail
@AmericanAir depends on the terminal, what' the best option? Arrive C, depart A. Breakfast burrito is what I'm craving.. Any update on 1119?
@USAirways your customer service is a joke. First a mechanical Cancelled Flightation, now weather. On hold since 5:30 am. No humans. Pls call me!
@united please tell CLT flight 4232 needs a gate. Waiting now for 15 mins.
@JetBlue cool! Are there stairs at JFK? I can walk short distances but not stairs.
@united need to chat with an actual human ASAP!
@JetBlue no, we are at a hotel.  Also, Jetblue lost my daughters luggage.  How do you lose luggage if the plane never actually left!!!
@USAirways would help if you flew bigger planes into TLH. All my team mates made it to the training but me.
@JetBlue I had to call back five times to get someone on the phone who knew what they were doing. By that time my getaway went up by $200.
@JetBlue 795 to Austin
@USAirways ordered a Scotch &amp; water and F/A asked if I wanted full glass or half? 60 yrs old and first time ever asked that????
@united thank you. We are signed up for notifications. We shall watch and wait! ❄️❄️
@USAirways hi there I am flying MYR-CLT-ORD tomorrow is weather looking ok or problematic?
@SouthwestAir  is there a route to flight from Mexico City to Chicago midway using your services?
@SouthwestAir check out our 1st grader's school science fair project. She loves flying on Southwest Airlines. http://t.co/BaYePZkMiz
@AmericanAir now we are all stuck on the plane after landing because crew unable to figure it out
@USAirways @AmericanAir as soon as I call customer service to speak to a representative, I am disconnected
@united service staff to is less than friendly!
@united just flew to #TelAviv paid $100 from a third suitcase which didn't even make it on the plane! Besides for the impolite service...
@United should find a way to distinguish boarding of premier members and credit card holders. Group 2 is too big!
@AmericanAir How is it possible that your call system can refuse callers for over twelve hours? What service options does that leave?
@SouthwestAir thanks so much for making my night 😀 cannot wait for my trip next week! http://t.co/NbZ45jCd1r
@JetBlue 2 hour delay while sitting on the plane and you still wanna charge me for beer? Nah, I'm good.
But I don't see AA @united
@united thank you
@SouthwestAir haha, thanks for the explanation
@AmericanAir I understand they're busy &amp; doing their best. My frustration is an automated call changing my flight w/o allowing me to talk
@USAirways is the worst. Why on earth would @AmericanAir merge with them? I won't be flying either of them any time soon.
@AmericanAir origin/destination/dates are the same. Going from US Airways connecting flight to AA direct flight. Award is saver level.
@SouthwestAir doesn't want to deal with me, but the world might want to know how they are treating their customers: http://t.co/sKKewqhssG
@united @JedediahBila KP I am not traveling - we trying to cheer up Ms. Bila.
@JetBlue Airways Short Interest Down 3.5% in January (JBLU) - sleekmoney http://t.co/znsUjP86Bv
@AmericanAir that's what is on my ticket and my confirmation email. Anything else?
@United why not charge for 2nd carryon instead of checked bag? Less jockeying for overhead space, happier passengers, more ontime departures
@VirginAmerica hahaha 😂@VirginAmerica YOU GUYS ARE AMAZING. I LOVE YOU GUYS!!!💗
&lt;3 &lt;3 RT @SouthwestAir! @danihampton Sorry to hear about the WiFi connection, Dani. Please DM us your conf # so we can help you. Thanks!
@AmericanAir @dfwairport me too!!  LOVE LIVING SO CLOSE SO I ALWAYS HAVE GREAT VIEWS!
@united thanks! Will you guys be getting the A380s anytime soon?
@united again, you said to go take the time to go there, knowing what the issue was, and knowing you won’t fix it.
@SouthwestAir freezing in the plane
@USAirways @PHLAirport we don't control your stupidity in not having room to have a plane come in. You better not mess with us now.
@SouthwestAir your flight attendants are really funny!! The sass is giving me life!!! 😂
@SouthwestAir Can I get any help with Cancelled Flighting my flight reservation?
@USAirways unable to locate baggage, this is frustrating. All my sons clothes and needs in it. #zfv #yyz #usairways #baggagelost
@AmericanAir but, what I can always rely on when I fly USAir or American is that employees will be rude and unhappy.
@United why can't you have an English/Spanish rep call me so we can locate my bag and resolve this issue?
@SouthwestAir Thanks, you guys are the best
@united just changed again.  This is crazy! #YourAgentsHaveNoClue http://t.co/A37N3oHOKL
@united Late Flight crew into #btv last nite delayed todays flt. Will miss connection to #cun. Why do I have to play for hotel tonight in #ewr?
@AmericanAir the motor that usually starts the engine is broke and @CVGairport ground crew failed to do it on time, per pilot #maintenance
@united how come the crew traveling on the flight gets a better seat and I get stuck checking my bag and the crews bag got on the flight.

@SouthwestAir I did ....it's just been such a disheartening experience for me and my family...and a lot of taxi money wasted.
@USAirways no problem.  Things worked out at airport.   Thanks!
@JetBlue flight 99 to DCA 2 delays, I'm all for erring on the side of safety but it's an inconvenience to people with connecting flights!!
@JetBlue full to capacity. I also pid extra for these seats. Perhaps the crew could be more helpful.
@AmericanAir are you guys intentionally trying to lose customers and money?
@usairways Is it possible to Cancelled Flight my reservation online?
@united when an airline causes the missed connection u would think they would take whatever steps to remedy that screw up.
@united Yeah sorry but there's always a problem with United. And you have an international reputation for having problems.
@USAirways I'm on flight 623 from DIA to Ontario tomorrow morning. no access to the airport via taxi or shuttle. What should I do?
@united can you ask your guys with flight 1146 to BWI to wait for us to get off a delayed flight from San Diego? Pretty please?
@SouthwestAir Awesome!!! Sending now.
@JetBlue Hi! Does my upcoming flight 2168 from West Palm to HPN have Fly-Fi?

@SouthwestAir I am now a rapids rewards member #lovetotravel #chaching
@united How does United refuse to reissue a $400 lost voucher when their plane didn't take off due to mechanics? #badcustomerservice
@AmericanAir Priority baggage evidently means it comes out last
@AmericanAir any idea on what the wait time is for refunds from @USAirways? I was told a few days over the phone - but it's well past that.
@JetBlue We had 2 great flights into and out of the Bahamas, even during the bad weather in the northeast, thanks for the great service!!!
@AmericanAir what terminal LHR for aa5/BA1506? Doesn't say in boarding pass
😳 LOLOLOLOLOL “@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/YXSwFq9tGP”
@AmericanAir pretty frustrating when you can't even stay on hold to get help after a flight Cancelled Flightation!
@united - Kids left a kindle fire HD 6 onboard UA1037 (ORD-SFO) today. Row 9ABC-DEF (we had the whole row amongst the 5 of us).  Help...
@JetBlue Learning about your awesome twitter management today in my Social Media Marketing class! keep up the good work! @SXU @PhD_Mama_
@AmericanAir 3 months of straight travel ahead. Time to find new airline.
@AmericanAir I was on a flight for tomorrow and my reservation is coming up.  Help me!
@united you get a 2nd chance today as I fly to A'dam. Let's see if you can redeem yourself after that last horrendous trip to the states.
@AmericanAir I’ve been on the line waiting for 40 minutes again.
@united delayed another hour
@united but then again, maybe the @BBBNE_SD_KS_IA would care more to hear what went on than whoever listens to issues you caused
@united updated A320 aircraft has wifi and device entertainment but no outlets. I don't get it. How can I charge devices?
@USAirways -beg to differ. 4 things booked wrong and still not fixed. Get your act together! #USAirSucks
@AmericanAir please can you tell me why DFW has a weather advisory and RDU does not? the entire state of NC has shut down from ice &amp; snow!
@USAirways I am following you now
@SouthwestAir I've been on hold for an hour now. 59:57 as I type this. Ridiculous! All I need is the link to the chart that has routes, time
@JetBlue no, I haven't done that yet. Is that something I can do online? Thx!
@JetBlue Didn't find out my flight for NY, scheduled to leave at 9:30pm, is delayed by more than 1.5hrs until AFTER checking in. Huge fail.
@JetBlue I've used you guys for 10 years but after this experience I will NEVER EVER use you again.
@VirginAmerica @JezzieGoldz club Virgin is bumping in New York http://t.co/HaQc7GDg7c
@AmericanAir No it isn't -  sheer incompetence was reigning at DFW today. I was there. On a plane on the GD runway. I doubt you were.
@SouthwestAir my flight was Cancelled Flightled Monday.  Just looking to Cancelled Flight and credit my card.  That's all.
@VirginAmerica I’m looking forward to watching the Oscars on my flight home tomorrow. I might even get something bubbly to drink! ;)
@united thank you for listening to my compliant and doing the right thing. I appreciate you working with me
@USAirways What a great way to kick someone when they are down. Cancelled Flight a noon flight and rebook me on one two hours south from here tomorrow
@AmericanAir - Can you please give me a travel agent support phone number? I cant find it on your website. Thanks.
@AmericanAir Not only was 5418 Late Flight, but we've been boarded and waiting for over 30min. WTF?
@JetBlue Celebrates 15-Year Anniversary With New Livery - @CNNMoney http://t.co/p7skxZVe1A
@SouthwestAir PWM direct to Orlando on Saturdays, why is this only happening in March? I thought it was going to be a permanent thing. :(
@united Would be nice if @staralliance partner tickets that don't provide full PQM credit are more obvious before purchase. Lost 1,200 miles
@JetBlue dang. Pandora? Does it look like it may get pushed back more or is this likely it?
@JetBlue you service agents at MCO are great, but their are not enough of them working right now!
@SouthwestAir flight was Cancelled Flightled and it won't let me rebook online. Wait time on phone is too long. Please help
@USAirways Flights 890 was the delay, Flight 5136 was my missed connection… Help!
@AmericanAir WHAT IS GOING ON?  This is pathetic. Online doesn't work and phone wants $25 to give a seat assignment.
@JetBlue No, the flight wasn't until 9:51pm, but it's already been delayed.
@united I'm not sure how you can help. Your flight experience is terrible, planes are dirty and staff is rude. Start over perhaps?
@JetBlue You left 175 PEOPLE on a hot plane with no ventilation for over an hour and a half and then had to bus them to JFK because of ....
@united need assistance. Line is out the door and travelling with 3 kids.
@united "We like hearing from you." So why haven't you replied to my tweet and/or email yet? https://t.co/caf2cx3gfi
@AmericanAir that would be appreciated. Just please don't send me to the same page with long form &amp; limited characters.Direct email?
@USAirways Expedia reserved a ticket for me and 2 more for a USAW flight but only issued 1. They are not responsive.Thoughts?
@united Currently on UA862, 20 minutes of the worst turbulence I've ever experienced, and ZERO communication from the flight deck.
@SouthwestAir ha, ha not a make or break for me either way!
@USAirways Three hour delay from Miami to London.  None of the other flights today are delayed. Put me on another flight!
@united Lindsay and ??.  Darn.  Terrible memory on my part.  I know they are headed back to IAD and then PIT tonight.
@JetBlue thanks for help. Can't wait to travel with! And get out of the snow.
@united already DM you my concern. Pls check.
@AmericanAir - very upset with my hometown airline. Stuck in Den Flt Cancelled Flightled. Others here with me got new Flt info
@AmericanAir 4369. about 4 flights all using same gate w/buses to the planes.  Awful boarding process. Hour and a half Late Flight
@united Pls post video of belligerent jerk ranting at SFO (1230) that's he's going to sue you for making him check his 3rd bag. He's a hoot!
@AmericanAir as usual my next flight shows on time but it's suppose to leave in 5 minutes and hasn't boarded
@AmericanAir I can't work with them if the call gets cut off while I'm still holding..... Is DFW looking any better tomorrow?
@AmericanAir Thank you.....you do the same!!
@JetBlue  would love to go to Hawaii to visit pearl harbor.
@southwestair has 22 employees on Social Care Team, 4 staff the Listening Ctr. at any time-rest of spots filled by other areas. #RaganDisney
@united holy high speed internet batman!  Speeds at United Club at IAD are insanely fast!  Thanks
@USAirways yes, I was rebooked the next day (Weds). Thanks. Just upset that I lost 2 additional work days AND paid for my own hotel. #losing
@SouthwestAir we're flying out tomorrow! PLEASE DONT Cancelled Flight!! Lol 😜✈️
@AmericanAir but, what I can always rely on when I fly USAir or American is that employees will be rude and unhappy.
@VirginAmerica having problems Flight Booking Problems on the web site. keeps giving me an error and to contact by phone.  phone is 30 minute wait.
@SouthwestAir Received awesome phone help from Jim today. Helped me switch around flights booked with points.
@AmericanAir @SouljaCoy what is AA going to do to fix their utterly embarrassing customer service? You won't even answer the dang phone!
@SouthwestAir I have a child traveling cross country...she's 11 will be turning 12 in march...and (cont) http://t.co/Enh1keUUTd
@USAirways I'm trying to Request Missed Mileage and it keeps saying it can't my flight from 2/13. Then it says call the number.
@SouthwestAir  placed on hold for total of two hours today after flight was Cancelled Flightled. Online option not available. What to do?
@USAirways flight 437 PHX&gt;ORD.  Lead FA Bill is the most professional FA I have seen in 9 years of flying USAir. I have no AB cards. :-(
@SouthwestAir I hope this isn't a real life scene out of the movie 'Flight' .....
@united you Cancelled Flighted our flights for no reason &amp; now we have been on the phone for AN HOUR on our vacation. Why?
@united except all of that delayed the flight anyway.
@USAirways We have submitted the customer relations form and await your response!
@SouthwestAir My bag was not shown LUV did not make it to PHL with me.
@USAirways thanks for telling me my flight was on time when the plane was broken. You're an inferior airline.
@united On hold 2X 60 min ea. Trying to bk a tix to Asia. Your website &amp; customer service dont want my business. Korea Air it is.
@AmericanAir what happened?? We didn't get a notification about a departure Cancelled Flightation tomorrow. Why will it take 2 hrs to talk to someone
@AmericanAir Lost and Found is like talking to a hormonal teenager who refuses to talk to you. #useless #wastedeffort #FAIL
@AmericanAir emailed AAdvantage for status match ... still waiting.  Can't wait to move from @united but help me out here :)
@SouthwestAir will do - if you follow back I can DM that info
@SouthwestAir sent
@JetBlue Thank you ! What about Paris ? Could we arrange something from there ?
@JetBlue thank you #loyalmosaicmember
@united It's the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United
@USAirways @USAirways I used my AAdvantage Number connected to the USAirways when I booked tickets for friends. Will it benefit my account?
@SouthwestAir You've inspired me to start my own airline to combat your weak ass airline. sick of this shit
@united 45 minutes after arrival and no bags for most people. UA469 from den to ewr. How long should we wait until a ual rep comes here?
@SouthwestAir booked the 8th.... Save me an emergency exit... Gotta stretch out
@JetBlue - I did that as soon as I realized. Will they try to figure out who is stealing from people's bags? Security cameras? Anything?
@AmericanAir merged airlines do not work for FF programs. Very frustrating and the gate agents are to busy pouting to care. #AttitudeIssues
@united this will definitely be a trip to remember EWR-STI second of the season, first on seat 35A because it pays to be loyal!
@AmericanAir Yes and without my bags. 2 first class tickets to Tahiti would be nice. Just saying
@united your gate attendant had some snobby remarks, your customer service is like playing poker with my sisters kids!
@JetBlue why 730 and not 645 as scheduled?
@united Thanks for the reply. The box is not mine and I'm not missing one. It was added to my bag ....
@JetBlue what gives? Delayed over 2 hours at MCO to JFK. Every time!
@united Had to explain to a very over eager flight attendant trying to ask about my vision that my @ccicanine was not a guide dog!
@AmericanAir 2 months and still no exec platinum member cards. What gives?
@JetBlue's #ValentinesDay email was on point &amp; so clever! Thanks for being amazing, #JetBlue! #loveisintheair http://t.co/DoCmvoTWTI
@united yes when I got to the gate I specifically asked if there where any other seats.  Very discouraging to walk past the crew. 37d
@united has me #stranded (weather NOT to blame). 1hr+ hold to speak to an agent that doesn't understand the concept of time zones, thanks!
@USAirways now you have over 50 people in line. This is stupid!!! What the heck!
@JetBlue lmfao.
@VirginAmerica cutest salt and pepper shaker ever. Just when I think you guys can't get any better you just do! http://t.co/vC6Keulg2J
@SouthwestAir is there any estimate on when the holding for you online will end? I'm at an hour and forty minutes now. I need to rebook!!!
@AmericanAir that doesn't really answer my question. Maybe if I provide more details you can give me clarification...
@AmericanAir my boss is :)
@USAirways @MrRenevendez I've been trying to contact them for 24 hours already! Yesterday I waited 7 hours today 5+! http://t.co/gn30p75KqB
@USAirways quit being cheap and hire some call center employees. It shouldn't take half a day to call you
@USAirways stuck at the gate in Charlotte, NC waiting for "release papers" and a fix for a broken computer system.
@VirginAmerica you know what would be amazingly awesome? BOS-FLL PLEASE!!!!!!! I want to fly with only you.
@VirginAmerica plus you've added commercials to the experience... tacky.
@AmericanAir You've misunderstood. @USAirways WOULD NOT do a same day flight change for me. The gate agent said, "NO."
@SouthwestAir  flying Southwest for the first time to LGA with a layover in Atlanta!
@SouthwestAir Travel agent Darrel here at Love Field hosting a paper airplane contest to entertain all the children was so awesome to see!
@JetBlue can u see what's holding up flt 1002 bags? One bag came out nothing else for 10 minutes
@United Airlines Cancelled Flights OC FLL #flight today. $700 to switch. No notice no apology. Done flying #UnitedAirlines.
@USAirways - I'm in the Cust Svc line.  Your Charlotte, NC agents better be in their A game.
@SouthwestAir THANK YOU SO MUCH YOURE AMAZING IM GOING TO CRY OMG
@united I wasn't asking for a full refund but delaying me 3 hours and giving no reason should be enough to give partial credit
@SouthwestAir it would be nice if I could talk to an agent rather than get caught up w/ a promotion &amp; then be hung up on
@SouthwestAir very frustrated with your customer service.Open seats on earlier flight, $154 to change. What a rip off!!
@SouthwestAir seeing your workers time in and time out going above and beyond is why I love flying with you guys. Thank you!
@united THAT'S the tweet u choose to answer, to tell me you're not liable?! #youretheworst #neveragain
@JetBlue Thanks for the THIRD gate change http://t.co/UfBdr5AxeO
@USAirways you guys suck at JFK tonight -- oh this MORNING!!!
@JetBlue Denver-Boston 2/10 flight 994  and Boston-Denver 2/15 flight 493 (both planes!) visible snack crumbs on seats on all upon boarding
@USAirways help! Flight Cancelled Flighted, can't call because my phone doesn't work in Europe. Please help? Says I'm booked want to confirm.
@USAirways your new seat assignment service is an embarrassment to airlines and customers worldwide. #shameonyou #usairwayssucks
@USAirways every single time i fly you guys i am delayed at least 30 minutes. Every time. On flight 5612 out of #CLT to nola.
@AmericanAir Stuck on the plane in Charlotte.  Going to miss my connection.  No words from staff. Maybe some damn pretzels?
@united, and now while waiting for new pilot the door on plane BROKE. why am I global services status  on an airline that's unsafe? STUNNING
@SouthwestAir why must the 4:45pm nonstop BOS-BNA flight stop running after August 7???
@united Followback so I can DM plz
@AmericanAir cost me over 200 dollars because flight was Cancelled Flightled and couldn't even give me a food comp!! Fly @JetBlue @Delta they take
@HillAConlin @SouthwestAir hi! get a solar charger from Amazon! Game changer to plug usb into charge. :)
@united My flight UA1159 to Denver for #RMOUG15 has been re-cheduled 5 times.If I am no show, you'll know why! Ridiculous.
@united ridiculous! I have to be refunded whenever I get at my final destination or not!
@AmericanAir not sure why we are being made to stand in line outside for plane that isn't ready to board when I could be sitting inside
@united I keep getting kicked to an error message when trying to purchase a flight on http://t.co/p3N2w8JfpS. Have tried at least 4x.
@united 132 characters does not cover my reasons I'm afraid
@united care less about the person - although he walked away while I was complaining.  A man at 10p at LAX club.  More.....
@AmericanAir I made my flight but then still had no update emails when I landed, no info ever sent on that or second flight. Losing my biz.
@USAirways I would appreciate a call regarding a HORRIBLE experience I had with a gate agent. Was on hold for 39 min and then hung on me.
@united yes refund my ticket and give me email address to let u know what happened
@united that's funny because I emailed @VirginAtlantic once and they found it hadn't left LHR. In the mean time stuck with no bag in NYC!!!
@USAirways Your exchange/credit policies are worthless and shadier than the White House. Dissatisfied to the nines right now.
BLOCK ME BIKE RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/2z3hGqPRSG
@united it's highly unprofessional for you to overbook a flight by 12 seats &amp;feel that I should rearrange my schedule for your mismanagement
@AmericanAir Why doesn't anyone make a better effort to retain customers. It should be an easy fix, I just want to travel AA.
@AmericanAir need assistance. very frustrated I can't reach reservations by phone. trying to book online &amp; get "fare no longer avail" msg
@SouthwestAir @JohnWayneAir Thank you both very much!!
@united, Understandable. I did try Flight Booking Problems several times for 2 passengers &amp; got the messages I mentioned before. As for the agents price???
@VirginAmerica Just bought tix for ATX - Dallas route - thanks for adding that! Love yr airline &amp; yr website is BEST transactional site EVER
@JetBlue Flight 1951. Bags haven't come and we landed 30 minutes ago.
@AmericanAir Reservation Line won't let me speak to a representative because they are too busy. They literally disconnect you. Why bother?
@united my flight was supposed to depart to Boston at 4:36 and now it's departing at 6:30 due to issues with finding a pilot. Thanks a lot!!
@united that's of course in lax
@AmericanAir thank you for the confirmation.
@AmericanAir 12 calls in the span of two days........none of which available to speak to someone.  You are un F-in believable.  worst ever
@SouthwestAir I'm gonna ignore the fasten seatbelt sign and I want to see if ur man enough to do anything about it!!!
@SouthwestAir why did you book my hotel twice?!?! Ahhhhh
@SouthwestAir Today is going to be the day, I can feel it!  Thank y'all for your support throughout! We're coming home Nashville! #Octavia
@united rude rude
@USAirways no online clearly states I can NOT- It says to call res. I already explained that.
@SouthwestAir any official word whether flight 3403 from BWI to Manchester is Cancelled Flightled? I've got an 8hr drive in snow if it is 😢
@jetblue, it would be nice if the app would actually inform you that a flight is delayed.
@united Flight was overbooked! Was offered voucher to wait &amp; take another flight. Gate agent switched me over, retracted voucher offer.
@SouthwestAir Problem is, I wasn't issued a position until today at the gate. And no option to upgrade. Not good when you're 6'4.
@SouthwestAir why can't you take me to Knoxville?? yall are my fav #help
@JetBlue poor storm customer service, 1hr takeoff delay waiting for the snack cart, rude steward (no names) and I love you guys. #TrueBlue
@united yes I've boarded this way many times &amp; have never had to show my pass on the Tarmac multiple times. Path was railed off. Only 1 way
@USAirways I am so disappointed with the service I received with you on my travels to NC these past few days .. you lost my baggage twice.
@united  No first class passenger should have to pay for inflight wifi.
@AmericanAir @TheNateK I submitted a complaint via that link in Dec. &amp; followed up in Jan. NEVER HEARD BACK! #badcustomerservice
@AmericanAir I wait 2+ hrs for CS to call me back re why  flt is cxld/protection &amp; they hang up the minute I answer on 1st ring?
@USAirways Disgusted with your poor customer service. U wrongfully remove &gt; 65,000 miles from my Dividend Miles and no live person,
@VirginAmerica Or watch some of the best student films in the country at 35,000 feet! #CMFat35000feet http://t.co/KEK5pDMGiF
@AmericanAir no kidding! Gonna take some beating on the apron... And there are some good lookin' planes out there!
@AmericanAir is the new @SpiritAirlines, and both are worse than taking the @GreyhoundBus #americanairlines #nocustomerservice #fail
@SouthwestAir plane switch on 636 meant A= back of plane #disappointed
@JetBlue's CEO Battles to Appease Passengers and Wall Street - http://t.co/frrfxCCw7Z http://t.co/nKlW9SsVRQ
@AmericanAir that's why I'm asking for exception. Staffer moving last minute,we're a nonprofit &amp; losing $400,we just want to change ticket.
@united look at all the delta flights that landed while your pilots claimed they couldn't fly 6232 to JAC. http://t.co/6Kp4m0R1f7
@united Thank you! Have a nice evening.
@united plz don't advertise wifi if it's not gonna work thanks #worstflightever
@AmericanAir trying to change flight via DFW tomorrow, can't get thru on phone, long wait then cut off x2, can you help please?
@VirginAmerica I &lt;3 pretty graphics. so much better than minimal iconography. :D
@United come on, reopen 1285 at ORD and clear your growing DC backlog
@USAirways please hogs my next flight for me! I'm waiting on a bus to get me off one plane so I can run to the other. It leaves in two min!
@USAirways the phone number the gate gave me doesn't work either. What is your customer service phone number?
@AmericanAir can you?
@SouthwestAir yeah they're somewhere. Hopefully getting them back today. Just frustrated tweeting.
@USAirways - just passed the 3 hour mark #onholdwith you for THIS call.  Gave up after 2.5 this morning.
@USAirways  really u gave 6 scotch on the rocks to an out of control drunk and would not let my sister change seats when he was grouping her
@USAirways is the worst!! Still haven't left.. Everyone missing connections.
@United has time to respond to everyone else's complaints but not mine. You just lost a customer
@JetBlue I DM'd my confirmation code... Thanks again for your help! Mommy, daddy, and kids appreciate it!
@SouthwestAir please PM me the number where I can lodge formal complaints. Thx
@AmericanAir because of you, I am doing the one thing I tried to avoid. Thank you for sending me to baggage claim.
@AmericanAir @sa_craig no gate agent, and only 3 PA updates for 3 hours, hinted at abandonment. horrible experience for all passengers.
@AmericanAir our flight attendant announced that we have transportation waiting for us for that flight so I think we'll make it.
@JetBlue why do this to me sending N598JB to UVF today and its a weekday why not a weekend :'(
@SouthwestAir @Imaginedragons @beatsmusic I'd love to hear them live at @VelourLive @velourlive this saturday! #destinationdragons
@united Is there a way to get  a copy of Feb's edition of Hemispheremagazine with out flying?
@SouthwestAir I've been a fan of imagine dragons since 2012 and they're my fave band and #DestinationDragons is during my bday can I get tix
@united Could you update me on the suitcase please? The online and phone tracking told me nothing. I was told I'd have it back yesterday!
@JetBlue @Maddie_Flood Your airline sounds outstanding and your Twitter feed is clearly extremely useful. Keep up the great work 😊
@USAirways Yes, it was Sunday.
@SouthwestAir yeah... that's not what happened. I'm really pissed. This is the kind of thing I expect from US or Austrian, not you.
@USAirways they had to turn the seat cushions over and clean the area. Please explain this issue?
@USAirways - BOS -&gt; DCA delayed again. This needs to stop. I will be filing complaints with the FAA and Consumer Affairs
@AmericanAir @ShannonBloom Where's my DM? Where's my voucher? Who's paying my $70 cab and my $50 car back to JFK tomorrow?
@AmericanAir my flight to DFW from LIT on my way to PDX tomorrow was Cancelled Flighted. Can you help me?
@USAirways Bravo handling MSP to PHX # 2023 today. Delayed, Late Flightr Cancelled Flightled. Missed surprise 60th bday which was reason for trip.Never again
@SouthwestAir Guys, we've got to do something about the inability to check in online for international  flight that has... (1/2)
@JetBlue Guess I'll wait another 24 hrs in hopes rate goes down &amp; is more reasonable. Fingers crossed. Cutting it close to my travel dates.
@USAirways 1-2! Rock hit the plane! In a delay now! Never an easy day with US Airways! Ya never fail to let me down!
@USAirways no problem...just funny have a nice day

@southwestair Great job celebrating #MardiGras2015 .  You own the industry . Another reason I'm nuts for you! http://t.co/8WBzOrRn3C
.@USAirways You'll be receiving a long &amp; detailed complaint letter soon. Long story short: never flying USAir again.
@united bad idea to let 200 people back on the terminal with food vouchers but allow only 15 minutes to get anything.  Long lines!! #ua1523
@united is horrible!! They lost our carseat and expect us to use a loner carseat, safety regulations say it's illegal to use a used car seat
@AmericanAir thank you so much that helps a lot.
@JetBlue thanks for making my trip home #MintyFresh next #brandmance flight I'll take more selfies! #LOVE #travel #business
@SouthwestAir Once again, I was able to change my flight without any fees... oh and the two free checked bags.  Best airline ever.
@JetBlue they are now being sent off the plane? Does anyone at JetBlue have a clue?
@USAirways This is how vacations get Cancelled Flightled been on hold ⤵for 40+ minutes still havent talked to anyone. #failure http://t.co/ef4P0HISHb

@JetBlue what's up w flt 4? Brothers fiancé sitting on board for 30mins w tech  issues.
@USAirways it shouldn't take longer to get to the gate than the flight itself takes.... 59 minutes flying time - 47 minutes on runway so far
@AmericanAir how comes no one has answered my calls or emails?
@USAirways how does an airline misplace an airline attendant?!! been at Reagan airport since 1pm10:15 to Cincy is delayed trying to find her

@SouthwestAir haha...yeah i did, just making a joke
@JetBlue ive tried on my phone and laptop :(
@united can we get an explanation on why UA978 from São Paulo to Houston has been delayed? Now we're hearing from crew about Cancelled Flightlations.
@united we rebooked and disappointed we have to wait a whole day to start our vacation. At these fares United should have top notch service
@united Any chance you are allowing reFlight Booking Problems yet for travel out of Denver this weekend due to impending storm?
@USAirways how do you lose a pilot????
@united I take it as a compliment that I was mistaken several times as a member of your staff on my flight... time to remove my scarf :)
@SouthwestAir making me miss #TheBachelor right now #wah
@JetBlue thanks! Calling right now!
“@USAirways: @ch_mom Please reach out to our crewmember for assistance. Our apologies for the long wait.” #generic
@AmericanAir literally just stopped allowing people to wait in line for customer service. Incredible. From worst to no customer service.
@JetBlue loved the service from the staff at Newark today. Good service goes along way.I appreciate your preciation  Nj ✈️Tampa 🔵🔵🔵

@USAirways Huge system problems at DCA.Manual check in; flight boarded but sitting at gate due to system issues. Frustrated Chairman member
@united Donna and Juan still the best in the United Club_ too bad UAL does not get it
@united my PQMs and PQDs are no longer showing up correctly in my MileagePlus acct. How can I get this fixed?
@JetBlue do bags still fly for free anymore?
@USAirways you have got to be kidding me!  No info on 4565 from DCA to BGR and your phone line tells me to call back Late Flightr?
@united Yes. About an hour after landing.
@AmericanAir over the last year 50% of my flights have been delayed or Cancelled Flightled.  I'm done with you.
@united  eventually.  You should approach bags like @AlaskaAir  they get it.
@united I am UA elite Gold and have a UA Chase pres. plus credit card.  How many EQM's do I need to get Platinum Elite!
@SouthwestAir Is there a way to receive a refund on a trip that was Cancelled Flight online instead of calling? Your phone lines are super busy.
@JetBlue while in Haiti Id do food distribution for hundreds of hungry kids in nearby villages. #flyingitforward http://t.co/lTf2quD3Xc
@SouthwestAir question all.  When will I receive my yearly bonus point accumulation? I think it's around now but not sure.  Thanks! :)
@AmericanAir Thanks! Are they really open 3.30 am - 7 pm every day? Any way to check they are open before going all the way there? Thanks.
@JetBlue Can you take @Cosmopolitan off your blacklist... trying to work :(
@SouthwestAir PLEASE HELP! I would die to see the Vegas show! It would be amazing to hear their songs for real!
@SouthwestAir can i have my bags back   ding!!
@united Also, your phone customer service is almost useless. http://t.co/Mb3bJwGOAp
@AmericanAir Huge thanks for fixing our flights! appreciate the customer service. now if only i could get seats assigned: me next to my wife
@united Useless response. I need a functioning wheelchair, not a customer care form to fill out.
@united if I pay you $25 and $35 for my luggage to be delivered when I arrive. Why should I have to wait 3 additional days for its delivery?
@AmericanAir already did- reply was "sorry. we believe this to be fair." as a journalist writing an article on my trip i will include this
@AmericanAir can you please help? you've now rebooked me incorrectly after flight was Cancelled Flightled. please fix my flt to Tuesday!!
