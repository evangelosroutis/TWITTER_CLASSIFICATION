@SouthwestAir Sorry to bother you, but I've been on hold for more than 2 hours and 30 minutes. Should I continue holding? Or call back?

@VirginAmerica Flight 0736 DAL to DCA 2/24 2:10pm. Tried to check in could not. Status please.
@SouthwestAir thx but I'll be expecting a credit for this leg.
@AmericanAir @cnnbrk they didn't address the assult or drinks spilled on her  the drunk passenger had to have a wheelchair to get off plane
@USAirways There is no reFlight Booking Problems the event I'm flying to attend. Waiting for jetway driver??? STILL ON TARMAC???
@united better just keep connection from ORD To FWA that boards in ten minutes open until I get off the plane that just landed an hour Late Flight
@united tried that already &amp; tried forgetting the wifi network connection. Still forces log in with incorrect email. Other suggestions?
@united missing my amazing us bank work conference, not ok.  What do I do now?????
@USAirways has to be the most lazy, inconsiderate, and unprofessional airline that I have ever traveled.
@united now we are trying to get to San Juan from Chicago O'Hare. Having lots of problems. May get a standby flight.
@JetBlue early last month via Expedia-there's an extra middle name and initial attached to my last name
@AmericanAir After being patient about my "delayed" bags for 5 weeks, I was told that it could take another 3 to 5 weeks. Unacceptable!
@united FYI: continuous texts and emails I am getting about the delay while held captive on the tarmac are not that helpful.
@USAirways #555PHLtoSLC this is happening now.
@JetBlue My Flight 1318 is delayed and I am connecting from Boston. Is it possible to switch me to Flight 118 so I can make my connection?
@united "Airport snow removal method #22..."Keep up the good work folks, this is where Cessna's become 747's! http://t.co/9v8tMUsJvU
@united 40+ minutes waiting at the gate for the broken jetway. Different gate maybe?
@JetBlue ‚Äôs Marty St. George really has zero clue. How does he still have a job? #nobaggagefees http://t.co/tjDzaMHPEw
@united we needed to be at steamboat for a meeting by 3pm so we took a shuttle. The United customer service people said the bag would be on
@SouthwestAir Yeah, we figured it out.  Thanks.
@JetBlue   Phone agents can't see same flights I see online???  Can't change tickets even when I am paying. Very frustrating #jetblue

@AmericanAir i have tried getting help from agents, the phone, twitter, and FB. Can no one at American Airlines help me?
@USAirways 1st flight with U.S. Air Plane had mechanical issues. Wait 90 minutes for help from customer service. No help from management
@SouthwestAir First there were cockroaches crawling on the counter at the gate and visible mouse traps under the seats at the gate
@USAirways would you consider honoring the original fare price if I were to try Flight Booking Problems the ticket again?
@JetBlue just lost my business   Enjoy your profits

@JetBlue thank you. Just sent msg.
@AmericanAir extremely upset that your baggage handlers decide to go in my luggage and take my belongings
@AmericanAir I would like to thank the customer service team for their response to my Cancelled Flightled flight but just offering to (cont)
@USAirways this is going to take up to an hour--not okay USAir. Not okay. This is ruining everything.
.@VirginAmerica I don't understand why you need a DM to give me an answer on if you have a damaged luggage policy.
@united  once again your customer service at the providence airport was horrible. Do you actually care about customers or just making money?
@USAirways your customer service at CLT is terrible!!! My flight was delayed from JFK for 2 hours!  Get to CLT to horrid customer service!
@USAirways  I open the credit card and earn 44,000+ miles, and you wont' credit the miles to my account to restore the forfeited miles
@SouthwestAir why are you literally the worst?

@SouthwestAir Hi! Winter Wx Advisory issued for STL. Snow &amp; Ice &amp; Cold, oh my! Will you issue a travel advisory for that?
@united it's frustrating, as a frequent flyer, loyal since Continental. Upgrade equals paying 3 times or more on top of purchase ticket.
@JetBlue Big thanks to Ricardo Olavarria at Reagan Airport. Fixed our ticket and made sure we made it for our friend's wedding #greatservice
@JetBlue Just left #LaGuardia now...#Sunshine in a little over 2 hours

@AmericanAir Why offer automated call back option when agent is available only to call me &amp; have me sit on hold? At 12:30am. #onholdfordays
@united it's amazing really.
@united you are lightyears ahead of the security control at Newark airport. They wasted 40 precious mins w bad efficiency. #frightening
@AmericanAir my wife is stuck in #Brownsville any chance she can get any flight out? She needs to be at work tomorrow morning.

@USAirways @PHLAirport this is the reason I avoid @PHLAirport and @USAirways like the plague. Glad to see this merger is working well. #dumb
@JetBlue thanks for the response - when is the next flight after the 9:48 flight?
@USAirways is the 7th circle of hell right after the dmv. #noshadetothedmv
@JetBlue note the time this was taken (now at 906 am) and flight still listed as on time for 910 when I'm not onboard http://t.co/zvfmxnuELJ
@united Thanks for the lack of help and the canned response from the 1K desk!
@JetBlue We even went to the airport and were on the phone for hrs and no help at all. Everyone said different things.
@united Looking forward to flying with you guys as well !!

@JetBlue lolol @s_myc88
@SouthwestAir Southwest is definitely my favorite airline to fly! :D
@USAirways The captain turned off the seat belt sign so people can get up and walk around.  That's not good.
@VirginAmerica CEO says #Southwest &amp; #jetblue have strayed from low cost model.http://t.co/96Sctomh29
@JetBlue  will do.
@SouthwestAir understand you can only do so much but often it seems like a quick request to the desk is all it takes no questions asked.
@AmericanAir If the flight I selected online was what was ticketed I would not be missing my connection. I need help getting to DFW or IAH!!
@Jetblue Delay = Perfect time to learn Swift programming with @TeamTreehouse
@SouthwestAir @ClinicPolly Thank you-- I may have already responded but was 8UXZJ2
@SouthwestAir where was the inclement weather? Other flights left DCA today and this plane appeared to be coming from AUS.
@united the we got into the gate at IAH on time and have given our seats and closed the flight. If you know people is arriving, have to wait
@USAirways rant cont... To top it all off, rescheduled flight to TPA at 10:10 is already delayed. How can they be that bad?
@USAirways had 2 Cancelled Flight my trip to LA bc weather @SouthwestAir was easy but US air is making me pay $200 to use the credit. Never again
@SouthwestAir Thanks.

@SouthwestAir thanks for the b day concert I watched them all (and noticed the fist bump/high five at the end of the "rock" version)
@united We were told by United to "carry over/carry back" for the refund.
@USAirways thanks! It's hectic for everyone but their actions don't represent the company well IMO
@USAirways seriously buy some WD40 for A319 operating flight 634 from GEG to Phoenix. Every seat squeaks w every shift. Still on ground!

@JetBlue We're flight 1472 FFL to LGA. Scheduled departure 8:15p.
@USAirways if I try and call your reservations line will someone answer the phone now or will I be on hold for an hour again?
@AmericanAir this is ridiculous! You all really have terrible customer service and a lack of urgency. Im convinced.
@united uhuh.Group trying to get out of Nashville and into IAD today instead of tomorrow,why be preemptive though... https://t.co/yBv0xaowKv

@AmericanAir Cancelled Flights flights arbitrarily on same itinerary.  Weekend ruined for no good reason! No crew = missed Monday am mtg.
@SouthwestAir they were moved to the 210pm flight #4649. Main concern now is luggage arriving with them. They were told that SW was having
@SouthwestAir fortunately didn't have to. The flight took off on time.
@united I have a question about my interview process I had only one interview but was the last person is that good or bad

@USAirways not moving we are in the tarmac delayed for some unknown reason. I'll keep you posted
@united my bag is a few days Late Flight to me and this is like the 3rd time in the past couple months.  Where my free miles at?!
@AmericanAir Retrain in Customer Service first, make proper adjustments when Cancelled Flightling flights. Own up to your Mistakes.
@SouthwestAir how do I get my companion pass?
@united they did on a delta flight out of LAX which is why I should be compensated for my rental car there.
@JetBlue Statement on #Lufthansa Incentive Offer - Stockhouse http://t.co/obF9jbPc6A
@USAirways Thank you, @USAirways!  Your fare to from DTW to DCA was much lower than @Delta and @SouthwestAir!  Thank you! You won me over!
@AmericanAir you are beyond redemption. Jfk. Baggage claim looks like a luggage warehouse
@JetBlue there is no supervisor available, so they couldn't do anything.
@USAirways - flights 4500 AND 403 delayed for "crew availability?"  What gives? I'm getting to TPA 2.5 hrs past my scheduled arrival.
@JetBlue okay so anything using contactless EMV should work, just your internal testing and training is currently Apple Pay specific?
@USAirways You landed me at #BWI instead of @Reagan_Airport  and have no plans for me to make it home to DC. How do you suggest I get home?
@USAirways thank you
@united I have $20 and I'll draw you a super sweet picture of your choosing. Will that get me round-trip to San Diego? üå¥üå¥ It's so cold here.
@AmericanAir my key point of confusion is whether I can make this change even though the initial Flight Booking Problems was on US Airways metal?
@USAirways I've been on hold for one hour and four minutes for your reservations line. How can you possibly do business this way?
@SouthwestAir looking forward to the beats music available on my flight today. That's pretty cool.
@USAirways There is nothing on my USAir CC at this point, but the email stated I would be charged.  Thanks for the reply.
@united says @USAirways  is the final carrier . Us air doesnt have it. I want my bag!!! Not a claim not an im  sorry. I want my clothes!!
@SouthwestAir Finally! Integration w/ passbook is a great Valentine gift - better then chocoLate Flight. You do heart me.
@JetBlue Accepting #Apple Pay - Mobile Enterprise http://t.co/Ci5cfrlqBe
@JetBlue Help - I left my Nikon camera under the seat in front of me. What do I do?
@SouthwestAir thank you : 8UXZJ2Paid for early bird and sat in back
@united They let us know in advance of the reboot, yes :) Thanks for the attentiveness!
@AmericanAir would have been nice if the agents were at the very least courteous since the delay was AA's fault
@USAirways I will write CR. Not sure what good it'll do as the customer service I experienced was horrible.
@SouthwestAir Was going for the weekend for friend's birthday, so no point in reFlight Booking Problems.
@USAirways hey!!  Yeah last time I got a phone call when flight was Cancelled Flightled from DCA to BOS
@united should contact me and the others on my flight who can't get their website to work. None of our info is valid! http://t.co/3zpJr7kWbk

@SouthwestAir flying flight 3130 tonight at 7:20 from PBI- I have boarding position C-42. Is it overbooked? Really don't want to be bumped!
@JetBlue thanks so much for your condolences and quick response. It is very much appreciated
@JetBlue it's noting about me i m perfectly fine it's the attitude and dealings with flyers. Stubborn. Demanding. Unwilling to accommodate.
@united you're good. Thank you!
@JetBlue saved the day:) @Expedia lost a costumer #jetblue #makingthingseasy #feelbetter
@united thank you!
@JetBlue service getting worse and worse. Plane can't fly waiting on a 2nd aircraft. So much for planning.
@SouthwestAir I wish i would've seen this 4 hours ago!!! I WANTED TO SEE THEM TONIGHT SO BAD!!!! #CRYING
@JetBlue so what about California
@SouthwestAir my friends from Boston stuck in Denver. Her name Jane. @RnCahill  Please contact her.
@JetBlue no baggage crew update!  Your staff is incompetent with no answers after 2 hours....
@USAirways just informed of three hour delay. Pick up the phone and get me on another flight!
@united on flight 1665 but it's not departing! Website says delayed due to operational difficulties-what does that mean?
@AmericanAir Would love to DM you, but my Twitter app says you're not following me and I can't.
@SouthwestAir: #VIPLiveintheVieyard - first time we tried to redeem pts for *anything*, it really did not go well. #disappointed
@USAirways today's flight to Philadelphia.  It's a little disappointing for the unnecessary delays and it's not even snowing in FL.
@AmericanAir Yes, thank you. Just not how I wanted to start my vacation!
@AmericanAir we did for the last 8 hours.  Your customer service is horrendous.  I should have flown Delta
@SouthwestAir @PoteetTJ had to fly @Delta MCO-&gt;CMH for $400 b/c we cldnt reach SWA to reroute SWA 3104 Cancelled Flightlation. Voucher wld help.
@AmericanAir 3231DTW to LAG at 4:45. Flight Cancelled Flightled with no notice. Given a voucher to a dirty hotel, with no food vouchers or apology.
@AmericanAir Seats gvn away. 7 strangers in 2 Chicago. Rented van. Drove to toledo. No help, no offer, no hotel. http://t.co/nxQiJCoJNj
@united can't get anyone to deal with me in person. Cowardly customer service, I can't be looked in the eyes by anyone.
@JetBlue i deleted that tweet because one of your wonderful employees swooped in to help--faith restored. You are one of the good ones. üëç
@AmericanAir what's the status of flight 1357 out of sju?
@AmericanAir you have my money, you change my flight, and don't answer your phones! Any other suggestions so I can make my commitment??
@USAirways flt 419. 2+ hrs Late Flight, baggage + 1 more hr. Now I see they delivered my suitcase wet inside &amp; out. #NotHappy
@SouthwestAir how do I get a companion pass
Really? 9+hours???? @united: @JenniferWalshPR We don't like delays and do all we can to avoid them. We'll have you on your way ASAP
@united Boston is all self service. Swipe yr own boarding pass at gate. Most difficult: Tag your own bag. Not easy! #ImproveTheProcess
@SouthwestAir why have you guys jacked up the prices AFTER you said prices were going to be lowered? SMH
@SouthwestAir - thanks to the agent boarding 1137, ATL-AUS. Left my wallet on the inbound. He found it for me!
@united What if my NYC flight is delayed and I miss my connection to Sacramento from Chicago?
@AmericanAir Thank you for responding so quickly to my tweets I do appreciate that.
@AmericanAir Policy makers need to change their mindset on aviation. Flying is not for... http://t.co/DQnn0Rf1V8
@JetBlue you're still the best
@united Thank you.
I just need a place to sleep when I land without accommodations in PLS @AmericanAir!
@JetBlue any thoughts on waiver of change fees for travel out of Boston this weekend?
@USAirways but don't worry! They found a hotel, it's only 45min away. I got there around 11:30pm, no problem.
@USAirways PLEASE HELP need our plane to wait to go to #ELMIRA on Tarmac over an hr baggage took 45 and still not here thru customs
@JetBlue great flight http://t.co/E0R0NTO4TR
@JetBlue flight 98 DEN to JFK already 2hrs delayed. Any idea how that might change again due to weather forecast etc?
@united once again your customer service rep was rude!   I asked a question and in turn got attitude.  Jane was no help.  Disgusted again!
@VirginAmerica your beautiful front-end design is down right now; but it was cool to still book my ticket b/c all your back-end was secure.
@united I sent you a dm with my file reference number.. I just want to know if someone has located my bag even if it's not here yet.
@USAirways on the DL, send Ethan some new pants and some "white revive" laundry tabs. He's a great guy, good crew, he's just, err, single.
@united how much does it cost to check in an additional bag? Traveling from newark to glasgow. Thank you :)
@JetBlue what crew? No one here is helping.
@AmericanAir tomorrows flight Cancelled Flighted. I understand. Three hour wait for a call back and now 60 minutes on hold. Not cool.
@USAirways lost bags. Cant reach human. delivery driver says he won't give us carseat until we return loaner. We hv NO loanr.5084773604 HELP
@united Thanks - it's very helpful to understand that the reduced price seats that are sold at check-in have priority over the certificates.
@USAirways I've been on hold to rebook a Cancelled Flighted flight for over two hours. I know weather has a huge impact, but you should anticipate.
@united Of course. That was the start of my trip 3 wks. ago. Its gone further downhill on my return.
@AmericanAir   You neglected to mention the $200 fee per ticket.  I had a medical reason and still have had to jump thru hoops.
@JetBlue hey, so, Dre at Seatac check in needs a raise, stat. Dude gave me amazing customer service and made me feel valued. üëç
@united 12/13EWR-LAX UA1151 my seat/armrest broken discover after takeoff. flight full.FA filed report, who to chat with for partial refund?
@USAirways not too impressed with your airlines but I would feel a lot better flying with if you upgraded me up to first class tomorrow
@united flight 5903 stranded on Tarmac in Chicago. No gates available?! Plane getting very hot and uncomfortable.
@JetBlue Cancelled Flightling flights, sending out tickets, then not telling the buyer... #jetblue how is that allowed?
@united why do you want me to be loyal  if don't let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead
@JetBlue just please get my luggage from #2070 onto carousel 5 / Logan Airport and I'll be able to go home!
@VirginAmerica You'd think paying an extra $100 bucks RT for luggage might afford you hiring an extra hand at @sfo #lame
@AmericanAir Flight Cancelled Flighted 2nd time. Can't reach agent to reschedule. Can you call me?
@AmericanAir I've been trying to change a Thursday flight and there's a ridiculous wait time on the phone, and your website isn't helping
@AmericanAir to my destination. After waiting 2 hours and missing our second flight with them. Our #luggage made the flight though...
@united v upset with your disability  "services". When I told one of your employees I was carrying medical equipment she was very rude.
@JetBlue my flight 475 Cancelled Flighted due to lavatory problems. Can't confirm if they are gonna get a flight from Boston Logan Int
@USAirways I've been waiting for desk for 45 and on hold 36min and counting...photo of desk agent on phone not flattering.
@SouthwestAir 2 bags fly free!  So what's with all the carry-on's? #packingayak @BrianReganComic
@AmericanAir None of the #LAX flights into #DFW have been Cancelled Flightled. Those landing before and after ours are fine. Completely arbitrary.
@USAirways I'm on the flight, finally in the air. Not enough food to feed customers. No movie or entertainment on a 5 hr flight.
@USAirways I hope so. Last I spoke to the baggage team... they weren't sure what city my bag was in.
@USAirways US 728. Refuel; we've sat for so long. Pilot announces where the truck is. "Look, over there to the left!" Actual announcement.
@SouthwestAir What can we do to bring you back to Jackson, MS?! We miss you terribly around here. These other airlines are horrible!!
@SouthwestAir where do we start? I've already wasted 1.5 hrs of phone wait time already :-(
@JetBlue better find a way to get me to Puerto Rico tomorrow morning besides charging us three times in cash what we originally paid
@AmericanAir hey ho its not me losing any money (only you) just next make sure you stick to the "flyers right's booklet"
@AmericanAir flight number #2386
@united Awesome flight crew on UA1589, re the plane,  the  Jurassic period called and they want their dinosaur/plane back!
@SouthwestAir I've been on hold almost an hour! I LUV y'all but #ImJustSaying üòîüòîüòî http://t.co/t6fYyBHjhL
@SouthwestAir best airline üëå
@SouthwestAir 75 minutes and still waiting for skis to be unloaded. You should be ashamed. It's 1:30 in the morning.
@USAirways ok. Thank you
@USAirways I should also add the weather conditions are terrible. Expecting 18 inches of snow. Any advice?
@united please help trace my luggage which was put through without a name tag on 11 February 2014 at Albuquerque airport
@USAirways Really a letter that says you will discuss serving drunks more drinks that doesn't help the current situation
@SouthwestAir adding direct flights from #Columbus to #Oakland, @BostonLogan http://t.co/p8Vcz4XTHM via @DispatchAlerts
@JetBlue @roxydigital HAHA. you didn‚Äôt disappoint. Well done. #JVMChat
@AmericanAir Why not sell MCE during post door-close shuffle in same way u sell drinks/snacks? People on my flight self-upgraded w/o paying.
@AmericanAir I understand the weather issues. I don't understand how I was not notified of the Cancelled Flightlation, and had to realize it so Late Flight.
@AmericanAir Thanks, she did her best. Staying the night in Dallas, new trial to Detroit via Atlanta tomorrow, assuming no Cancelled Flightlations.
@SouthwestAir Sorry to spam, it would just be so awesome to see @Imaginedragons in Vegas. Your help would be absolutely amazing.
@USAirways flight 1898 landed over 2 hours ago and they still haven't gotten to the gate.. What's the hold uppp üò≠üò≠ #imtired #wannagohome
@AmericanAir yikes.
@SouthwestAir also, they said they couldn't even book the flight. They were having to put me on hold &amp; have someone else do it???
@AmericanAir my flight 1337 is Cancelled Flightled.  Can you let me know what my new flight info is?
@united I am a frequent user. Congrats u only lost my bags once in 20 years. Problem, it was today and your staff were rude!üò¢ still no bag!
@SouthwestAir sure. Fhk2te. Am scheduled to leave this weekend but need to push to October
@SouthwestAir - Apology accepted! #customerserviceWIN #itravelalot http://t.co/z5znfwkKWP
@AmericanAir I don't think you should help him at all based on his behavior. The voucher and cot seem like enough lol üòÉ
@united But why do people with no status get to buy an upgd at much less than cost ahead of premiers with earned "confirmed" certificates?
@AmericanAir Nice to read it! Thank you very much!
@United just played the Most bizarre "safety" video I've ever seen... http://t.co/Hlm2Oks6xl
@united On top of that I paid for 1st class and my wife got stuck in coach.
@united This must be a drone ‚Äú@united: @KeamBleam We understand your frustration. Our Bag team is working hard to get your bag(s) to you..."
@USAirways You should be prepared for Weather. All I want to do is find out if I can take train to PHL to catch my connection.
@united yep, after long waiting on the phone we managed to rebook it. Hope it will be a pleasent one. Thanks for ur help.
@SouthwestAir follow for a DM please. Need to confirm a Cancelled Flighted reservation
@united that's unfortunate. The @Tumitravel was an xmas gift and it looks like a razor ripped right through the front pocket in the picture
@united no I don't, but I'm sure United have my info on its system.
@USAirways @AmericanAir Sitting at the gate on Flight 719 for an hour due to computers being down. What backup plan is in place for this??
Keep Waiting, time does not cost anything for @JetBlue hundreds people how payed thousand dollars with no feedback http://t.co/Ji2pg4gom9
@JetBlue no. Not boarding order. Someone boarded with. Service Animal which a member of my party was allergic to and because the flight was
@USAirways how hard is it to unload bags in order of arrival? 45 mins and counting for flight 699
@JetBlue ..... No crew at our gate.
@united there are a lot of unhappy cold people on the bridge in freezing temps for an hour. Not given any info.
@united Thanks for your response. Bags came, but it was a long wait and priority tags weren't honored at all. Disappointing
@JetBlue I applied for a job at PDW where could I go for follow up. I'd really love the job #ilovejetblue
@united I'll let you know week after next when I do another coast-coast RT again.
@united just sent - thank you!
@AmericanAir I have been on hold 3 hours.  2 seconds of it with a rude agent.
@SouthwestAir bag in possession but no clothes in bag??
.@united Really? Was bumped down from Gold status, asked to pay $$ to keep it, and get fewer miles... How is that worth it?
@JetBlue bags hv been posted on board for flight424 on carsl 4. Now switched to carsl 5. It's comedic watching passengers run frm 1 to othr
@AmericanAir when changing dest city on an award for a reservation party of 4, is fee $150 for each pax or 150 for first and 25 for rest?
@AmericanAir #americanview New paint scheme looks great! #usairways http://t.co/Gt6umHbh43
.@AmericanAir @C2Next Would be great to get some help too! I've been trying since last night to get through.
@JetBlue Guys, really bad @JetBlue #fail . Someone better call my wife back to get this handled. 203-382-3312 while she waits on hold....
@USAirways I'm unable to check in for flight 2119 BOS-DCA and haven't heard if flight was Cancelled Flighted/rescheduled. Any updates??
@united A generic form with tons of fields asking for info you already?  Expected more as a premier platinum. Another #servicefail
@united two hour delay for a plane that was visible from the airport. So far terrible customer service. #neveragain
@united. epic fail. @reagan. no jetway. been here 15 mins on tarmac!
@united again I ask, who can I call to get this fixed? Tweeting me BS questions to stall only makes things worse. Phone number please.
@SouthwestAir it keeps saying that mobile boarding passes are unavailable despite having checked in and everything
@united is there a referral program for the Milageplus explorer card?
@united $55 cab ride to dfw from love got me my bag. Reimburse?
@AmericanAir 77min still on hold to chg award travel #sorrynotsorry
@AmericanAir yes. Shows Cancelled Flightled &amp; asks for her to contact you at 800 number.
@USAirways Sending thanks to employee Freddie in PHL Admiral Club A East for allowing me to give a day pass to my sibling stuck there today.
@AmericanAir @emeyerson @ggreenwald Don't wait on a bag. Go to Walmart and get what you need for tomorrow morning.
@USAirways #usairways lost a passenger today for not upholding their promise of excellent customer service!!!
@united WHAT?! Y'all have zero concept of customer service. Oh...and now my connection is delayed too!
@AmericanAir I have been on hold w/customer service line for 68 minutes.  This after I was on phone with an agent for 35 min b/f call droped

@AmericanAir unable to access the website.  Will try again.
@AmericanAir I have been trying to speak with an agent the whole day about my Cancelled Flightled flight, what I can do?
@USAirways I don't want your sympathy I want someone to make an effort to find my bag

@USAirways I need help locating my bag. I arrived in Denver last night at midnight from charlotte but my  8am flight to Hayden/steamboat
@SouthwestAir @gruber Finally.
@AmericanAir No worries they called back 4 hrs Late Flightr while I was asleep and took an additional $200 fee. So by AA standards everything's gr8
@AmericanAir Would have had to fly real far south, huh? #WinterWeather #Brrr

@JetBlue 2 aisles of empty #evermoreroom seats and we can't move bc we didn't pay?! #nonsense #Waste #JetBlue #jetbluebos #cheap
@USAirways still waiting! Captain reports he's called 6 times to get ground crew....and still sitting on runway. #evenLate Flightr
@united @campilley hahaha. If they weren't an American company, i would say this was great sarcasm!!
@SouthwestAir couldn't make flight, funds forfeited as a no show!! Was trying to book another flight using those funds, I'm out.
@USAirways &amp; there are seats together, they just have fees. Seems if I'm taking a 5am flight the least you can do is wave the $10.
@VirginAmerica it‚Äôs just a bug report, guys
@USAirways @AmericanAir Suggestions , been on hold 2 hrs for flight that is now about to pass departure...Dealing w ny weather, need change
@USAirways for a response in 3-4 days? No thanks
@USAirways Who intentionally buys a flight with a 10 hour layover?  And what kind of airline would charge $200 to fix it? Wow... #usairways
@AmericanAir does not know the meaning of customer service. Nightmare. Paid for direct flight. Bumped to Dallas. Flight Cancelled Flighted. Terrible
But expect no help from -&gt;@SouthwestAir &lt;-.  Our flt was canx at the last minute for "weather."  We flew home on weatherless @united.
@AmericanAir travel week, delays, Cancelled Flightlations, "if you want to learn more about the merger press 1", delay my connector in Chicago #deice
@united DM does not work what do I do?
@USAirways Waiting for my luggage on flight 1923. Is there a delay?
@JetBlue Think about it...boarding to a chill untz untz untz....like this http://t.co/lj2lARivE0...
@united Soooo, it's been 15 days and you've offered no response. So I assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now?
@united EWR ppl told me to call 1800#, have 2x/day since Monday. Still at layover loc. have that ref # tho. Any help appreciated.
@AmericanAir Dallas/Fort Worth flight number 5320

@SouthwestAir what is DM?
@AmericanAir really
@SouthwestAir Got it, thanks. Any insight into what will happen tomorrow?
@JetBlue 1242 now?! I may cry!
@united - thanks for the rude customer service and 3 hour delay. It really helped me timing wise for my afternoon meetings. Hello @Delta !
@USAirways should take a lesson from @SouthwestAir and wait for passengers from connecting flights. Shame..
@united you are one great airline ‚ù§Ô∏è
@united big up the pilot of 644 for turning 1hr on the tarmac to just a 20min delayed arrival
@AmericanAir ‚ÄúInconvenient‚Äù is such a convenient word.
@AmericanAir Last thing I want to deal w/ before 8 on a Mon! I've already waited the suggested wait time, so I hope I get a call back ASAP.
@United, #deaffriendly? Getting there. Read your review on http://t.co/2Brt0aTHaU: http://t.co/WzNp5q1M0H
@SouthwestAir my wife has now been on hold for 90 minutes....I get weather is bad, but this is insane. #customerservice #customerloyalty
@USAirways 3935. Sitting on a freezing bus because nobody is in the plane. What is up?
@JetBlue Thanks! See you soon!
@AmericanAir I fail to see how telling a caller that a bag may take "18 hours" to get from JFK to Brooklyn is "the best we can"
@USAirways @AmericanAir I was supposed to get from fresno to pittsburgh by 10pm.  Instead I'm now not getting in until 4pm... tomorrow
@USAirways Houston hub Aa T. Employee the bag is not here, It made it to Pa before me! Oops not your problem http://t.co/Uld0hWFkfo
@AmericanAir Its not that I wasn't offered "perks" by @USAirways.  I ASKED and was told, "NO." #thenewamerican
@SouthwestAir went to purchase a flight that I began processing not even 4 minutes earlier and the points had gone up - any help?
@united thank you!
@united I especially like how you upgraded three of your crew members to first class instead of passengers. #keepitclassy #customerservice
@united that's not an apology. Say it.
@USAirways Why did you put my luggage on the plane after mine? Then not deliver it to me like you said? Now show the claim as closed online?
@united Alright, thank you. Is there a page that says the routes you have for each aircraft? Specifically the 787.
@USAirways never flying #USAirways again. Horrible experience, terrible customer service.
@united can you help me with a delayed flight as im going to miss my connection?
@USAirways Will you guys be offering no-fee changes for flights out of DCA tomorrow afternoon?
@AmericanAir that's 16+ extra hours of travel time. Missed vacation time and now you guys are messing with my professional life.
@JetBlue waited for 15 min then got disconnect
@USAirways why won't you help me get my luggage back? I'm a teen trying to change the world in DC #Flight5182 #usairways
@JetBlue You definitely will!
@USAirways it a change fee request from a month ago.  after one hour on phone with your team, I‚Äôm told 120 day backlog.  Awful.
@united Yes ! :D (Y) From @therealaviation on Instagram :)
@SouthwestAir can you tell me if flight 805 from MDW-FLL tomorrow (2/24) is at full capacity?  i'm hoping for a little bit of extra room! üòä
@SouthwestAir I never got a Cancelled Flightlation text from this morning either #bushleague or a number to call #weakservice
@united @wamo66 after 2 hours and 20 minutes most of which I was on hold I was able to get the Cancelled Flightled flight changed to Delta.
@united I believe. It was Cancelled Flighted yesterday I guess. Goes back to no notification from United about Cancelled Flightlation
@USAirways I tried speaking to multiple people at your reservations desk after 30 min on hold. #waivethefee #poorcustomerservice #Neptune
@AmericanAir interested in possibly changing my flight to another day...need to see if there are any fees but your number is busy
@SouthwestAir Is there any way to get entry to the Las Vegas event to see @Imaginedragons perform? #DestinationDragons
@United how is it that I book a flight with a reserved seat and then go to check in and find out I have no seat?  WTF.
@JetBlue once you go blue you don't go back
@united is amazing how hard is to talk with customer service! !!
@USAirways I'm supposed to fly through Dallas. Can you help me get a new itinerary?
@JetBlue Thanks for the $100 credit because of the 4hr delay. I can tell customer service means a lot to YOU #Thankful
@USAirways don't think you guys could mess things up any more.. Never flying with you again!
@JetBlue yes, but it hurt my feelings to walk by MINT. A fella can dream. #happy4them

@VirginAmerica luggage was severely dented/missing wheel coming off baggage claim in SAN. Luggage agent Miranda (I think) wasn't any help.
@united tell me something I don't know...not #keepingit100 #weaktea

@AmericanAir I called reservation at 1 am and I'm still waiting for someone to call me back
@united so sorry. I ended up on US Air flight. Thank you though for getting back to me:)
@JetBlue we want room and food allowances. Agents are refusing to give us vouchers to use at rooms we book ourselves.
@AmericanAir Please help AA 2258 Monday Cancelled Flightled.  Can you advise on reFlight Booking Problems / refund.  Have children and need to make plans now
@VirginAmerica Is flight 769 on it's way? Was supposed to take off 30 minutes ago. Website still shows "On Time" not "In Flight". Thanks.
We didn't need this. RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/cpZB285o71
@JetBlue @JayVig YES! Great real-time example. Thanks for being awesome, #JetBlue! #JVMChat
@USAirways or how about power outlets at your seat if you're gonna keep us siting here forever?
@AmericanAir this delayed bag was for my friend Lisa Pafe. She got her bag after 3 days in Costa Rica. Issue no updates on your system.
@USAirways I have been on three planes for flight 1907 and still haven't left the ground BAD SERVICE #sad
@United Personal Device Entertainment system is great but with app crashing every 10/15 mins I'm glad it's free for now.
@AmericanAir been calling for over 24hrs now and getting no where but told to call back by the automated system is extremely frustrating
@united hello. I got off a flight a few months ago and constantly think about your peanuts. Is there anyway you could send me some?
@USAirways   my miles will expire on 2/29 and it could take someone 10 days to respond...I have over 150000 miles that I do not lose i‚ù§usair
@JetBlue supervisor humiliated us and was uncompromising. We were completely blindsided!
@JetBlue I sure hope you guys get me to DC to speak tomorrow! &amp; @JohnNosta &amp; @United: I'm winning here with @JetBlue
@JetBlue what are the chances of one of your flights leaving at 6am out of Newark nj being Cancelled Flightled tomorrow?
@SouthwestAir Not your finest moment in Boston right now!
@united no- we are boarding- but why can't your agents, on the phone, taking care of 1K travellers, link reservations?!?!!
@JetBlue what's the status of flight 1272 diverted to RIC?  When will it depart back for LGA?
@USAirways so you're not honoring miles with @united that were traveled last year?
@USAirways so I can make a reservation
@USAirways @PHLAirport how can a plane scheduled to come in on time and actually happen. Then you bozos don't have any room us. #incompetent
@JetBlue Airline trouble this winter &amp; not getting good customer service? contact http://t.co/aQjn4HwNaC  we negotiate resolutions for You!
@AmericanAir I FOUND MY FOOTAGE!! :D I am so so happy.
@united Do you have a further update on the suitcase today please.
.@JetBlue Ah grasshopper, your twitterz kung fu no good.  Hire geeks. http://t.co/8MWItRi9kF
@JetBlue okie doke! Knowing you, you will fix this ;)
@JetBlue I want to add, my flight to Mexico was on Air Canada. Same exact situation, but with none of the problems I've had with Jet Blue.
@AmericanAir - Hanging up on customers with no chance for a callback is a failure of customer service. 1:30am EST and no one can answer? 2/2
@JetBlue Why not just take her info in the beginning and if cut off, call back? We do that in my medical practice. We are frequent flyers :(
@united missed it.  Incoming on time, then Sat for 30, then no jetbridge driver...missed a 45min connection from an on time flight...
@SouthwestAir, I've been on hold for 3 hrs. now, waiting to talk to someone with a pulse to get my Cancelled Flighted flight rescheduled. Is this SOP?
@JetBlue should I expect delays at dca for 7am departure?  Going to Orlando on flight 723
@united but again UNITED DOESNT GIVE 2 SHITS ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS
@AmericanAir it shouldn't happen but did and has put us and our gear in jeopardy. What steps do you take to protect customers if their items
@JetBlue good to hear. Thx for being responsive.
@United‚Äã has Cancelled Flighted 1 arrival into SHV tonight &amp; the 1st departure flight on Mon, Feb 23rd. Check with your airline for flight status.
@united Bag MIA since Wednesday. Still no word where it is or if we'll ever see it again. #lostluggage #frustrated
@united First Officer of UA 1514 checking our 757 prior to departure from EWR yesterday while on his cell. Safety ??? http://t.co/1TFH2v0a7z
@JetBlue Thanks for offering this service, guys! http://t.co/xDjzkC34GB
@JetBlue are yall going bankrupt or is inflation just really bad these days? You went from $50 to $120 for overweight fees! Outrageous
@USAirways nervous for flight tomrw out of key west not friendly customer service
@JetBlue I have a internal bleed in my foot, and I am flying next Tuesday, what should I. Do :( these. Leeds come randomly. I
@USAirways I bougth ticket same fligths twice and you dont refund money it is big problem other company refund money why dont u pay back
@USAirways if there are empty first class seats on my flight at check in, why wouldn't I be automatically upgraded?
@AmericanAir Thanks for your canned response that makes it look like you care about your customers. I'm sure all Twitter users fall for it..
@AmericanAir delayed.....wow
@united Calls to 800# resulted in 2hrs of hold time &amp; 2day wait to check suspect code share fare. Nothing investigated‚Äîmy time wasted (2/2)
@JetBlue I travel for business twice a week and after the @AmericanAir fiasco, I'll be flying blue more often. Thanks.
@AmericanAir they will just say dumb things to beat around the bush ! If you're flight Cancelled Flightled be prepared for no compassion from them
@AmericanAir yes. We spent the whole day talking to agents and someone finally offered to let him stay in a hotel
@united Monday evening.
@SouthwestAir Thank you for taking good care of people with ALS! http://t.co/m1yyWAFkFI @KevinSwan_ @ALSTDI @A_Life_Story_
@SouthwestAir very confusing to receive "your trip is around the corner!" email when I already Cancelled Flightled the flight
@USAirways Handled on the phone. Unfortunately it wiped out an entire trip, which is why I'm so displeased.
@AmericanAir is profiting in the billions and throwing crap at the people who put them there. American is a hurting brand
@united worked out after all. Thanks for your immediate reply!!
@AmericanAir get me outta here
@united 6 hour mechanical delay...killing me
@SouthwestAir do new flights come out at midnight?
@united DM the conf # to you - did you receive it?
@united Is a snowboard boot bag included in the standard checked baggage next to the snowboard bag?
@USAirways you idiots kept an on time plane on the Tarmac for over an hour forcing us to not be there 10 minutes before.
@SouthwestAir no you are not, you just care about mighty dollar.
@JetBlue, never been delayed before; 533 to TPA out of BDL. Better safe than sorry. üíô #lovejetblue #onlyblue #jetblueforever
@united hilarious
@JetBlue ticket issued whilst delivering your customers.
@JetBlue ugh always know a way to my heart üòòüôå
@SouthwestAir How do I enter passport information on an existing reservation before check in?
@SouthwestAir just disconnected my call after 2.5 hours without even speaking to me. #octaviannightmare
@JetBlue they couldn't do it sun then it was supposed to be mon after 6pm then today from 11 to 3 then from 6 to 8
@JetBlue Hey guys do you have a tail number assigned yet to flight 1373 for tomorrow?
@united thank you for leaving my bag in houston! despite what your system says, i was definitely on the flight!
@AmericanAir is there something wrong with the website? no matter what flight I select, it says it's no longer available.
@JetBlue that is great. But once it gets to Buffalo will it be able to leave and get to JFK? Or there's issues still at Buffalo airport?
@united ...would be on the next flight to Hayden/steamboat
@united thanks, i made it.
@JetBlue it is absurd that I have waited more than 45mins because the flight attendant assigned for my flight is Late Flight. You dont have others?
@united just kidding with you I'll send you my stuff now. Thanks
@united kudos for not Cancelled Flightling flights from DFW this morning.   United usually first to panic...
@USAirways finally spoke with someone. I have to email the refund dept. I love you guys, but 6 hours in line to be told no dice sucks.
@USAirways need seat assignments for one leg of family's return flight - can you please help via Twitter PM?
@SouthwestAir, answered right away for a new res, but can't rebook the people that were supposed to leave today? Worst customer service.
@SouthwestAir were you handing out tickets while I was sleep ?
@JetBlue letting me down in San Fran. No Media rate? What's the deal? Looks like this is the last time I fly anywhere with you.
@USAirways you guys should be nice and just give your routes to jet blue and southwest.  At least they treat their customers properly.
@SouthwestAir I will not have my passport in time for my trip. Could I still fly with photo ID? #thingsishouldknow #ifeeldumb
@USAirways I have better Intel than she does!  She said plane is due in at 630.  Flightaware and your own app say 645
@USAirways due to your expensive change fees either. Out of all the airlines, we chose yours, all do you could screw us. STRANDED!! No help!
@JetBlue thanks. Can you change the music in the boarding gates?
Currently on @JetBlue, my new robotic love-doll. Reminded heavily of @pattonoswalt's bit about them-hence an excuse to say "huxleyesque."
@SouthwestAir Had a bad experience with them last week.  They broke my bicycle that I had brought with me to do a bike ride in Fla.  Why?
@AmericanAir you have let me down. Seriously. #unhappycustomer
@VirginAmerica mood lighting on pointüôå Reclining my seat, kickin up my feetüí§
@USAirways that is the most useless tweet I've ever seen out of you.
@united - #epicfail from a former gate agent in PIA!  He walked away and quit! Luckily a responsible PIA agent saved the day!
@SouthwestAir I just sent it over
@JetBlue it's only because I'm wearing #TrueBlueColors!
@united he has no priority and Iove it
@AmericanAir booked AA3370 departing JFK 2/25/15. It was booked via BA and I want to change my FF# to AA can you do that for me via Twitter?
@USAirways any way to tell our gate we are going? Stuck on tarmack, int'l flt FLT 878 going to ELM Gate F6
@AmericanAir @USAirways day has come where I was suppose to get my money back from you but my bank hasn't received anything but after

@SouthwestAir oops, Sorry, Done,
@jetblue is giving me false hope of ever getting home
@united  your costumer service today in the Providence airport was sucked. Recommend your airline learn to check the weather and be honest
@JetBlue I‚Äôm getting an ‚Äúit depends‚Äù vibe. Fair enough!
@NinaDavuluri We think it's a treat to have you onboard! Enjoy your flight. üíô
@SouthwestAir will do! #heart #flying
@USAirways I sent email to customer.relations@aa.com. Will this work?
@USAirways Your system is affected by the weather?

@united.  Pls hold UA2066 for 9 cnx pax frm UA6194.  All runners.  A 5 min hold will save 2 fam frm miscnx.  Pls. Twitter is watching.
@united Now submitted for the third time, please check and confirm receipt. Have taken screen shots in case it disappears again. Thanks
@united, link to current status of flights/airports? Fly BWI-EWR-MCO this morning yet can't yet tell what any problems are except see snow.
@JetBlue is a joke. Missed my connecting flight by 5 minutes. Last flight of the day and they don't hold it.  5 minutes.
@united I've got a campus visit in an hour and I'm still wearing the same clothes...
.@AmericanAir No. I watched these bags be abandoned at depart gate. Watched for &gt;40 mins until owner returned, 20+ mins after I reported
@SouthwestAir @FortuneMagazine Love u Southwest. You've always been helpful. When I traveled a lot w/my son, infant/toddler, U were great!
Why lord why‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/nlzS1Ehnee‚Äù
@united What happens on 9:11 a.m. of 9/11 2spooky 4me m8 such spook much scare
@AmericanAir I had booked online but unable to Cancelled Flight online. But finally got thru.
@JetBlue alittle more money to book our flights... we're 1/2 way there :)
@united 24 hrs since flight landed and ZERO info on my missing bag? rough ETA would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence
@JetBlue Using JetBlue air miles?
@united that would be great
@united you've been officially displaced by @DeltaAssist for better flight experience, pleasant cabin crew and timeliness. UA 1m switching!
@united And there is no direct phone number for status match desk? I really regret Flight Booking Problems with @united now.
@united - watched the entire #UNCvsDUKE game on the Tarmac before Cancelled Flighting my flight because crew timed out, right before my 4hr flight....
@VirginAmerica not worried, it's been a great ride in a new plane with great crew. All airlines should be like this.
@united said they would give us a refund. 30 days Late Flightr NO refund.
@AmericanAir I'm still patiently waiting for a response to my complaint email on Fri. What is the normal response time?
@united ok, I have that, pretty sure I had it before too but will wait and see what happens....
@jetblue trading customer experience for short term $$. So sad for this (previous?) loyal customer. https://t.co/dFmvmiBH4x
@AmericanAir submitted a case to AA customer relations two weeks ago, no word ever since! whats the point of even having CR?
@united +the plane.
@SouthwestAir I am in, let's do this!
@SouthwestAir just sent it
@united flt 1583 EWR to SFO excellent service. Friendly flight attendants. made the 6AM flight a very good start to the day.
@JetBlue Gotcha... thanks for the update. I'm ready to go whenever you are :) Enjoy your evening.
@united flight 3870 to Newark, stuck in the runway. About to miss my connection and they are just sorry for my inconvenience!!!!!!
@united #worst2unitedflightsever UA1429 IAD to LAS 2/19 mechanical problems - switched aircraft delayed 3.5 hours!
@AmericanAir @USAirways Yes, obviously! It just stinks that 4pm is the one option when she was supposed to fly at 7AM YESTERDAY.
@JetBlue absolutely no worries. I'm just never flying with you again. Ever. Even I have to hitch hike cross country #passengersarepeople
@AmericanAir Amazing to watch @chasefoster (who travels with celebs all over the world) show the youth of America who *not* to fly with.
@AmericanAir has the worst flight change policy. No mercy, no sympathy, such a bummer when you can't go to funerals or see friends bc of it.
@SouthwestAir thanks for getting me home from Denver tonight despite the snow!
@JetBlue imma need the hook up tho
@JetBlue you all are the best #flyfi # ondemand #leatherseats #hipunis #legroom
@virginamerica Digging the swanky pink mood lighting during the flight from NYC to SFO.  Just needs a cabaret singer.  Think about it!
@JetBlue since high likelihood of snow at time of flight tomorrow, any chance I can rebook for Sunday?
@AmericanAir thanks for finally letting me get through to book my flight. Frustration  set in... #donedeal #talktoahuman
@united now this http://t.co/uygeW2Nosr
@JetBlue tried them not helpful. Really dissatisfied with Flight Booking Problems my whole trip with jet blue this time around besides the flights.
@SouthwestAir The in-browser hover over is intrusive and annoying. And the fact that the WiFi only works on one device is sort of sad.
@USAirways UR service is so shitty. Pilot never showed up so we waited hours because another pilot was supposed to come but didn't #Cancelled Flighted
@USAirways I tried calling for yet another delayed flight and was told the phone line couldn't handle the volume and was hung up on. Twice.
@united how come a $27 shuttle bus from LGA to EWR has electrical power outlets but our new Airbus interiors do not? #whyjeff?
@AmericanAir I guess it is more BS AirportCardio given you cannot have an on time flight
@JetBlue Hopefully now my application for JetBlue donut designer will finally go through the proper channels.
Thx! Stand by! ‚Äú@united: @rajuchinthala I know it's frustrating and I do appreciate your patience while we try to get you on your way. ^JH‚Äù
@AmericanAir lovely flight back from MIA to LHR - great crew - thanks :-))
@AmericanAir just Cancelled Flightled my 7 am flight tomorrow with out informing me at all today, then booked one in 2 days, and no customer service
@USAirways thank you!!!
@AmericanAir I had an advantage # and you deactivated it. I don't think you should deactivate a customers acct without their knowledge #help
@SouthwestAir #promotion fly 3 roundtrip #flights to and from #ATL between 2/15 and 5/17 and get a companion pass for the year #travel
@united i need help but in spanish
@JetBlue haha no need to apologize üòÅ I'll be Flight Booking Problems sooner than Late Flightr. I love JetBlue
@united we had four scheduled flights on this reservation and literally did not take one! Unreal
@JetBlue i'm getting info from the website, but needing to check it and the alerts would be much more beneficial.
.@united thanks for the reply. I saw that but it's not particularly helpful to a hungry vegetarian not flying those specific flights. SHRUG.
@usairways you mean 10:30pm. I'd be in vegas by now if I'd been allowed on my original flight.
@USAirways thank you. We filled out a claim and hope to have the bags tomorrow.
@USAirways yay for glitchy tracking system!  My bags made it to my destination and not Laguardia like the app said!
@AmericanAir spent $8 for the choppiest feed of "Whiplash" ever. #americanairlinesfail #iwantmymoneyback
@USAirways My flight was delayed and rerouted, and not so much as a "sorry for your inconvenience" from the check-in agent? #notimpressed
@VirginAmerica I did it but there was a problem in the link from the email for check-in. thanks
@SouthwestAir how does your pre boarding process work? Basically anyone who doesn't want to wait their turn can get a slip?
@USAirways Is your refund system down?
@JetBlue any good deals for March?! Looking to fly to Orlando!
@united I'm a minor and freaking out bc I might not make my connecting flight to Hawaii so yes I'm frustrated
@united look at the people tryn to sleep in the airport due to your shitty company not comping rooms after cxl flight http://t.co/o1u96Xc3bo
@JetBlue why do you have every channel but @ABCNetwork How are @kgonzales89 and I supposed to watch Scandal? But free FlyFi is sweet!
@AmericanAir I've been trying to call your reservations desk for past 12 hours and can't get through.  This is not what I expected.
@JetBlue any idea when November-December 2015 travel opens up?
@SouthwestAir flying back to Denver tomorrow. Should I rebook?
@JetBlue  I did.  They have no idea where it is.
@USAirways my friends at KPHL were told by your rep "if it were me I woulda just gone home this am and tried again tomorrow." 1/2
@USAirways ‚Äî I had exceptional service on flight #403 from IND to PHX!!
@AmericanAir 2284, four hours Late Flightrs and we are finally flying out...too bad I missed my event
@united DM'ed you
@united Held up for almost 45 minutes and then promised free movies and it didn't work and neither did the wifi that was paid for. Boo :(
@AmericanAir did you guys get rid of the functionality on http://t.co/R1OQAVEO7I to put a reservation on hold for 24 hours? i don't see it
@united #flightdelay on an early craft arrival because pilot is stuck in traffic #fail #nocustomerservice #nocompensation
@SouthwestAir I got it added thank you! :)
Thanks! Hope I don't look like a complainer, I've written of good experiences w/you in the past and am making do in terminal 5 :) @JetBlue
@United agent did help me. My point: there's a problem &amp; I don't want it to mess up somebody else's plans. Can u flow this to tech team pls?
@VirginAmerica Grouping Virgin in with the others now. BOS weather has exposed their actual Cus Serv model. Never Flight Booking Problems with Virgin again!
@AmericanAir trying to get home is beyond complicated. It's should not be this hard. Students are split up and we will not fly AA ever again
@JetBlue you got yourselves hot ladies flying the air for life #loyal
‚Äú@JetBlue: We‚Äôre looking for our next #FlyingItForward flier from DC Tell us where you'd fly &amp; why http://t.co/MCSI0dzpnz‚Äù @geekandahalf
@southwestair Grand total from landing to getting bag: one hour. That's very sad.
@AmericanAir yes it is in Dulles and I need it delivered to the Embassy Suites in Herndon, VA. I'm still in Chicago from the fiasco in LAX
@united Your boarding process sucks. You should learn from @SouthwestAir
@USAirways car services to and from the hotel, food, hotel cost bc of Cancelled Flightlations fall on the customer with last minute notifications
@JetBlue What's up with delays to and from Boston today? My sister is trying to go home, and bro-in-law trying to come to RDU. Craziness!
@united I have a 0530 flight out of DFW on Tuesday. How far in advance will you give notice if Cancelled Flightled?
@JetBlue I lost a day at the airport and off my trip, I should be compensated for the inconvenience!!!!!
@AmericanAir you flew me into Chi instead and I got a ride to MKE. U said my bags would go to MKE today. Is it on the Cancelled Flightled flight tho?
@united anyone awake? Paying for wifi on iPhone when need to be using it on laptop. Logout option for wifi in flight? Time is wasting!
@united If an award is no longer showing available could it possible become available again?
@jetblue we never received that $15 credit for inoperable tv's on our SFO &gt; JFK flight 2 weeks ago. never got an email...
@united thanks for the link, now finally arrived in Brussels, 9 h after schedule...
@USAirways who would like to watch the video of how loyal customers are really treated while asking for an explanation for our 6 hour delay?
@USAirways Credit to my bank account for the two days of work that I've missed because of these Cancelled Flightlations.
@united airlines delayed our flight on the way to Chicago and leaving Chicago. Next time @Delta it is.
@united - Thanks. Formed submitted. I'm not betting someone would be honest enough to turn it in though...
@SouthwestAir Please bring back RDU to FLL direct route!  I noticed it is missing starting in Late Flight August!  The flights are always packed!
@JetBlue would you say a delay is more likely? Thanks so much.
@JetBlue I would go to Las Vegas. It is gorgeous and I go there every year and I fly with you guys Vegas is gorgeous &amp; so much to do there.üå¥
@AmericanAir just wow Regina just told me I can't file or request a lost bag statement until I finish my travel.  So until I get to DC argg
So appreciated! @united
@JetBlue There's just so many choices for y'all south of the border and I know not every airline is equal - lowest price != best value. ;)
@jetblue is there no way to switch to earlier flight to JFK even if I checked a bag?
@USAirways how long is that flight? http://t.co/bCwckWtnlE
@USAirways So you understand why I'm resorting to Twitter: No help available at  gate while this occurred or by phone afterward.
@SouthwestAir how do get priority seating after you already paid for the flight
@JetBlue It's not so much the delays as the fact that the flight is still coming up as on time on your app. Just give us an honest estimate
@united do you expect to Cancelled Flight flights out of @DENAirport tomorrow morning given the storm?
@USAirways worst customer service. ticket was 180 and fee is 200 it's "not worth it" for them accommodate me given circumstances in BOS
@united Supposedly, they're out for delivery. I'll believe it when I see it.
@united even so, change could not be made  online- instructed to call an agent- maybe the syastem should allow agents 2 link passengers!
@VirginAmerica delayed to10.30!!
@AmericanAir lost @LeslieWolfson luggage on flight yesterday morning #Miami to #NewYork #LGA no response and no luggage more than 37 hrs ltr
@VirginAmerica Your back of seat entertainment system does not accept credit cards that  have an apostrophe in the surname. #apostrophefail
@JetBlue Need your help. I'm moving to DC &amp; I want to book a one way fare on your website. It won't seem to let me. Am I missing something?
@USAirways she just did but really how drunk does someone have to be before you stop serving them
@USAirways can they change to correct last name? Did via reservations already but said can't change ticket name..
@USAirways this very pregnant lady's hoping &amp;praying hubbys flight from BWI gets off the ground! I'd like him to get here before baby does!
@united tried calling too, but w/25 min phn wait means we'd miss options anyway
@jetblue We'd love to help Shanese Bryant-Melton, a hard-working grandmother from DC, go to Miami. It's on her bucket list. #flyitforward
@VirginAmerica Do you guys know your check-in links from emails are broken? http://t.co/2npXB6oBMr
@JetBlue whatever your lil #mint heart desires! http://t.co/WmX12F33ZC
@united Club DEN, East or West, both are disgusting. http://t.co/XijYrPsLZK

@SouthwestAir @livvyports16 and I became best friends Bcuz of @Imaginedragons is there any other way?
@JetBlue  I'm game if you're buying!!  ;)
@united Yeah, I tried that about 10 times for two different tickets, and it told me to "Try again Late Flightr".
This is so smart it makes me angry MT @JetBlue: We‚Äôve partnered with @WSJ to bring you free digital access onboard! http://t.co/0LiwEcAsOe
@AmericanAir Need to hold or get a call back. Just get hung up on by your phone system for 6+ hours now.

@USAirways @AmericanAir we are missing our connection due to delay out of LAS. What are we supposed to do now?
@united I mean, your employees were really nice as I literally sobbed?
@USAirways Yes &amp; have already spent 1K+ on the card &amp; paid the $89 annual fee, but the 50K miles have not shown up. Want to fly AUS --&gt; ATL

@AmericanAir DM sent. Answer me please
@united you a bish
@USAirways no word on delay reasons @LGB but Twitter is aflame with flight tracking computer crash. Rumors. True or Not?
@SouthwestAir I'm just calling to Cancelled Flight a flight. I already rebooked it on another card. Just need to Cancelled Flight the previous reservation.
@usairways Thx for responding :) When bags came there was mad rush towards end of jetway‚Äîwhy not just put thru baggage claim?
@SouthwestAir no thanks
@USAirways your checkin at @PHLAirport is a #shitshow, and the agent behind the counter who tried to send me to the wrong destination=rude!
@JetBlue Really!? That's good to hear! Thanks for the update @walls29 We may make that business meeting after all.
@AmericanAir stranded for 24 hours in MIA, Patrick casimir has been the ONLY AA staff to apologize for the great inconvenience #unreal
@JetBlue time to reevaluate my nyc carrier.
@JetBlue but by Cancelled Flighting my flight and pushing me to the next day I'd lose $150 hotel which was why I was trying to get a same-day flight.

@AmericanAir See photo of 787 model &amp; our PN 320008A wheel deflator specified in Chapter 32 of B787 AMM. http://t.co/oilnCfWEyg
@USAirways your agent did not say
@united Bos-SF was in between waivers. Business Cancelled Flighted due to weather before/after. No flexibility/compassion in extreme circumstances = üòî
@USAirways OK she is worried that something is wrong with the flight - #1870 - and should she consider flying earlier
@AmericanAir *does = doesn't
@AmericanAir you suck worst airline ever I will never be flying you again I have been stuck here for 13 hours no one is helping #fuckoff
@AmericanAir how is US4623 going to be on time when they are still deplaning at 4:08? This is BS.
@united can you tell me how to file a claim for clothing that had to be purchased?
@SouthwestAir baggage delivery at BWI very delayed and unnecessarily chaotic. Disappointing after a long trip! From a frequent traveler
@SouthwestAir After flying Delta this week, GoGo was so good. The tweet I sent you didn't even send until we landed - that's how bad it was
@USAirways stranded at BWI after two diversions. No cust service, no transport. Dumped here. Terrible customer service!
@AmericanAir  2 hours to be answered on a call?
@united Flight 6212...massive fail! They delaying to transport a crew member causing many to miss connections! Unreal!
@united 1k and had problem getting out of FLL to IAH  sent DM to you about making my connection  please let me know
@JetBlue C'mon now. My flight's delayed annnnnd you can't give me a pick?!? I'm about to tweet at @united or @Delta .......
@USAirways I would happily wait in the terminal near food, restrooms and non irritated passengers.
@SouthwestAir I sent you my conf number yesterday.
@USAirways it was customer service like I have never seen before!  Kudos to your organization.
@USAirways Hooray! I've now been on hold for over an hour. I've never loved Southwest more.

@united you are easily the worst company I have ever experienced. You have lost someone's personal possessions &amp; you couldn't care less!....
@AmericanAir ok. There is no one at the airport that is helping us. Another customer got told the flight isn't leaving till 1220
@AmericanAir Thanks. Two hours to go inflight, then hotel.  Hang in there with all the DFW travel delays AA team.
@USAirways that you would let us just switch to a different set of flights so we could spend time with the family after he passes away...

@SouthwestAir flying by myself is getting old
@JetBlue PDX to JFK was suuuuper HOT.
@united Existing reservation is fine. I was talking about no longer having an 0600 CMH-ORD option. 0638 gets me in too Late Flight.
@USAirways 3hr30min right now...  any end in sight?
@AmericanAir @beantownmatty Sounds like a date!
@SouthwestAir easy fix, let the business select actually board 1st, then board the pre-boards...
@SouthwestAir I recommend upgrading your IVR and using call back, email, and texting from a know caller.

@USAirways I get some bs from a guy at the door says door closes 10 minutes before it backs out. Yet I know for a fact it was 5 people short

@AmericanAir @Nashinmypants lmao this is so funny
@united actually we did not consider she might have made a mistake. She did not complain beyond that she indicated it on her reservation.
@VirginAmerica my goodness your people @love field are amazing under pressure ‚ù§Ô∏èfrom Texas #beatstheothers in crisis Please fly me to NY

@united if the car seat is lost @united should just reimburse me for a new one, this is not a pair of shoes, it's a necessity for my child
@SouthwestAir how long does it take for my Rapid Rewards points to be credited to my account?
@AmericanAir why does your customer service line say "we are experiencing high call volume" and then spontaneously hangup on the person?
@USAirways - Huge props to Parizad at checkin in Sacramento for her help on Friday to get 3 of us home when other airlines were delayed
@united Was just hung up on by customer service after waiting 30 min on hold...guess that vacation's not happening? Website wasn't working.
.@AmericanAir @USAirways Add insult to injury you guys "misplaced" my bag. Can't believe you have to pay money to be treated this poorly.
@VirginAmerica I miss the #nerdbird in San Jose
@AmericanAir again, no special meal catered for me in F JFK-LAX. thankfully i'm on qantas the rest of way-i fear what youd NOT cater on that
@united of course I would like hepl! Are you kidding me? That's the ONLY reason I've been on hold for the past 5 hours!
@USAirways standby so far for two of us. With snow storm hitting Iowa tomorrow we could be stuck here for two days.
@USAirways yeah , I have been expecting The same for 3 hours
@SouthwestAir I've been on hold for an hour &amp; a half trying to change my flight to BNA. Not very happy with customer service right now!!!!!!
@united Agent in LAS letting 20 customers know they can't help them rebook delayed flight to DEN #unfriendlyskies http://t.co/QuzVmK2rTR
@AmericanAir pretty lame response to a two paged single spaced letter http://t.co/aCebo6ELPa
@JetBlue Usually I have such a great experience with you guys? Very, very unhappy with you right now.
@USAirways will do.  maybe the pre-purchase meal email is because the flight is 9 min short of 3 hours, so I guess there are none offered
@AmericanAir yes we did make it home. But by no means am I happy. I've always chosen AA as my 1st choice when flying, I'm rethinking that...
@USAirways @jtrexsocial i fell asleep from a call i placed midght.. guess what still on hold 7 am
@AmericanAir Am on web site requesting refund for Cancelled Flightled flight. It requires numerical document number. Where get it?
@united ... frozen lines on flight, not continuing due to 'passenger comfort'? Not ok, sat on the plane as long as a flight to Vegas would !
@SouthwestAir go @franks105 go!
@JetBlue Call me when you do and we‚Äôll have to hook up!
@JetBlue Safety might be your priority but organization clearly is not.
@united After all I have been through on this trip, can you get me on another airline home?
@united sorry for the delayed response. It was UA #381 Chicago to San Fran. Held up for almost an hour on the Tarmac. Also, lost my bags
@SouthwestAir about time! Thank you!
@united -today the staff @ MSP took customer service to a new level. My father passed away last night &amp; you helped me get home today! Thanks
@JetBlue They just came out. Thanks for the follow-up. That's why you're the best!
@USAirways too Late Flight.
@USAirways where are my bags?
@SouthwestAir @SacIntlAirport Feels like a good day to fly!!  Thanks for the ontime departure to SNA!!:) #bestinclass #30000ft #takemehome
@united - flight 1114. Unfortunately this isn't an isoLate Flightd incident. I haven't waited less than 20min in years
@united has the worst flight attendants. They are like those angry and drunk aunts that we all have. Everything has to be an argument.
@AmericanAir  Did you guys just give up helping people? Your phone tree just hangs up on me and I have a flight tomorrow. Connection pending
@JetBlue No not yet. I will notify them. I'm new at this! üòä
@SouthwestAir thanks for an awesome flight and connection! We were delayed but your staff and crew were purely amazing!
@united I just want to contact someone with a question &amp; not be put on hold for 5 minutes in order to be hung up on or sent to the pet line
@SouthwestAir Worst customer service ever. You Cancelled Flightled my connecting flight to NY hours ago &amp; didn't tell me. Now I'm stuck in Tampa.
@AmericanAir this is awful customer service.
@USAirways @AmericanAir are u paying incedentals? #noworstairline
@united thank you thank you thank you for contacting me. Thank you for the offer of a $1000 travel certificate #unitedairlines
@JetBlue we are on flight 751 and were returning to the gate can you provide any information?
@USAirways Every time I try, the line is disconnected b/c the system says you have too many calls. Glad your screw up matters so much to you
@SouthwestAir I would love a great deal from bwi to las Memorial Day weekend aka my bday weekend üò¨
@united okay - thanks for your help, JT! I appreciate your time!
@SouthwestAir you got me home over an hour and a half Late Flight but at least my baggage was delivered soaking wet
@SouthwestAir Can someone rebook me? Please direct message me.
@united pushing five hours and my time is worth nothing to you. reFlight Booking Problems not an option unfortunately.
@SouthwestAir I was trying to find airfare for my family.  Your prices are ridiculous!  Almost $1000 more than @USAirways. #notmadeofmoney
@AmericanAir I did 50 times and no one was helpful I'm missing work nd school nd the manager REM from mia told me he didn't want to talk us
@JetBlue if I'm about to get on a plane, I think I deserve to know what the mechanical issues are for the flight being delayed.
@USAirways @PhilaCarService looks like a long trip from cancun to philly? 9 hours Late Flight? Seriously?
Yessir RT ‚Äú@AmericanAir: @yourlocalnyer Good morning, Rob. We're showing the flight to sunny Mexico just pushed off the gate.‚Äù
@VirginAmerica any plans to start flying direct from DAL to LAS?
@JetBlue But if customer service ment anything to you.... you would try. Quoting policy is never effective customer service.
@JetBlue just had a horrible experience with check in agent at fort myers, I'll document and send details, off to Boston
@AmericanAir too Late Flight now. Boarded, exit rows taken. Could not have gotten worse. Guy next 2 me should've bought 2 seats. #miserablemorning
@AmericanAir and it gets better...other passengers rebooked direct on other airlines. #whereisthelove #whybeAAFF?
@AmericanAir Thank you for the response, we got it resolved at the counter.
@JetBlue actually flight 1089 not 1098
@JetBlue thanks for your prompt response. I know you put safety first. Unfortunately will hit freezing rain/sleet on ride home.
@USAirways Know what I like about gate 35X @NationalAirpor ? Nothin.I like nothin bout yo #ghettofab gate #USAirways http://t.co/mAqw2nLNiU
@united flight arrives 30 minutes early, but then have we to wait for an hour for our bags.
@united My wife and I will be sharing this dreadful experience. Don't pretend UA cares about young girl traveling alone # United Airlines
@AmericanAir even with calls you haven't been able to help us anyway. #nevergettinghome
@SouthwestAir  your checkin is lame for business. Really last seat? I have broad shoulders haha
@SouthwestAir Flight 2078 to Balt hit turbulence, babies cried, kids vomited. Chaos. Flight attendant Caroline was a superhero.
@JetBlue not cool. At the gate, turns out my flight from FLL to JAX is delayed, yet app says on time. Not a good start.
@VirginAmerica announces new nonstop connecting @AUStinAirport &amp; @DallasLoveField, $39 intro: http://t.co/qXnOaQtYN8 http://t.co/JK7qmdfqgf
@SouthwestAir delayed twice now Cancelled Flighted...sent complaint email, yet no response.  Need an explanation pls. #notsatisfied #smh #unhappy
@united look at the Twitter history - as usual service non existent
@AmericanAir thanks for following up- it finally worked!! Fingers crossed the new flight works.
@USAirways flight is already over. I think the airline should just have the flight attendants actually emphasize that VAPE is still smoking
@virginamerica how's a direct flight FLL-&gt;SFO have unexpected layover in Vegas 4 fuel yet peeps next to me bought for Vegas flight. #sneaky
@AmericanAir - answer the phones.  Trying to change a reservation and haven't been able to get a human to pick up in two days.
@JetBlue I would go to Italy to visit my relatives and see the house my dad left when he passed.
@JetBlue 4 hr delay on flight to JFK via Tampa &amp; worst customer service in San Juan airport. This after app not working all day.
@united Please msg me a # for customer service. I will have an invoice for my dry cleaning but won't be able take wet clothes to the airport
@AmericanAir I've been trying for 4 hours to get hold of someone.
@AmericanAir there's an employee at gate 45 of JFK telling people their bag doesn't fit and needs to be checked when it clearly fits #AA291
@united somehow I knew that you'd wait until I was airborne to respond. #hacks #jokers #neveragain.
@SouthwestAir A little surprised my Early Bird got me B15 from DEN to KC just now. Worst I've had. What's up?
@United What's your phone number? Customer service question.
@VirginAmerica Giants and Virgin America. A match made in heaven.
@united or us air: http://t.co/Eis9hcNPrO
@united 100. % failure in 2015 #UnitedAirlines
@AmericanAir No, had already waited an hour for it and wanted to get home.
@americanair anxious to see how you all care for customers you‚Äôve inconvenienced #Cancelled Flightledflight
@SouthwestAir @NotPghTimothy no exceptions for national awards?
@SouthwestAir I am completely displeased with the service I received on yesterday flying from LGA to ATL.
@USAirways Yeah I know that...but now I'll have to spend almost 500 dollars more on my ticket since the price has gone up over the week
@united I am following - you need to follow me for DM?
@usairways 2+ hr wait &amp; really bad exp @PHLAirport. luggage won't arrive w/ me Do I really have 2go back LAS airport 2 pick up when arrives?
@SouthwestAir Hey southwest! I wanna go to see @Imaginedragons ! You guys are a lot better then jet blue.
@SouthwestAir won't answer their phones #HorribleService #NeverAgain #frustrated #AnswerThePhone
@AmericanAir I even went to ticket counter and got no help
@USAirways over 4 weeks since you took our money and left us stranded 9 hours from home. Had to rent a car and you still have not helped us
@SouthwestAir your "complimentary" hotel vouchers are BS! $79 a night for the crappiest hotel ever! I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy!
@USAirways They provided no options. Since you all have a better sense of the weather, I hoped you could suggest.
@united GRK13575M is the file reference
@AmericanAir I still think American Airlines is great...I would just like to be treated better. Loyal customers first, right?
@JetBlue you're lucky we're still flying you after today's landing gear failure. Get your act together and help us sit with our kids!
@united not able to DM you my confirmation number
@JetBlue Thank you!
@AmericanAir thanks!
@SouthwestAir FIND A WAY TO Cancelled Flight FLIGHT 310!!!!!!!
@JetBlue I tried! Had me running from curb-side to self-check &amp; wasting even more time. Ended up Flight Booking Problems United for $$$, am so upset
@AmericanAir poor customer service is just unacceptable.. Also how bout the surfer on the front of your website. #noloveforsurfers #pretend
@united : Unhappy with United's service?Read Ralph Nader's open letter to UAL's CEO.Leave a comment or RT.http://t.co/O0745APIau
@SouthwestAir can i take my electric skateboard on a domestic flight? if so, do same policies listed on your site for regular boards apply?
@united Yes, myself and about 200 other people also.
@SouthwestAir  Longer flights with 300 series no wifi? Will be great when you retire them.
@SouthwestAir last 5 flights have all consistently ran behind schedule what's up with that ??
@AmericanAir my flight 129 to dallas and 259 to SFO has been Cancelled Flighted and they can't get me on anything else until tomorrow. You won't put
@AmericanAir @USAirways So who do I need to talk to to ensure the statement is sent to my bank so I can get the credit for the charges?
@USAirways you're really fudgin up with all these delays üò° #justwantmybed
@AmericanAir @kconti44 This looks like JFK - had a great pic of the OneWorld jets lined up on the opposite side #Air Berlin, LAN and AA.
@AmericanAir Your people on the phone can't see those? And to have it be over $800 difference. That's a poor process then...
@SouthwestAir Do you anticipate any Cancelled Flightlations for flights out of Nashville tomorrow? Thank you!
@United: I feel very well informed. yes, the flight is indeed delayed. Thank you. http://t.co/FuCHZRZjg5
@SouthwestAir  do you know where my plane is coming from?  I'm on SW flight 4464 from RSW to MKE
@lindaSWC @united:  We don't like to hear you had a poor experience. Please share details w/our Customer Care team http://t.co/HIsc4NdMgZ.
@united #1007 Houston-Bogota with an engine problem, mechanics trying to "fix" the problem, safety first, better to change the plane
@AmericanAir This doesn't address my issue. I am on hold for 30 min to speak with an agent.
@SouthwestAir my first flight ever and flight #4251 is already having technical issues. Faaaannntastic.üò≠
@united Arriving at the airport 2 hours before departure time and still missing your flight bc you actually don't have an electronic ticket
@USAirways I have to spend more than the cost of the flight just to get a free room and transportation to and from the airport
@JetBlue if you can't guarantee parents will sit with their children, don't sell tickets with that promise! #jetblue http://t.co/HDoXiM6NZ2
@SouthwestAir flight just Cancelled Flighted. Can you help me rebook?
@AmericanAir so what are you going to do for me since I can't take the option you gave me. What type of refund will you do for me?
@AmericanAir yes, it says it should be deliver within 6 hours after pick up line.
@AmericanAir now because you couldn't add my ktn, which I asked for numerous times and no one answers the phone, I missed my flight!!#upset
Do less please @JetBlue
@USAirways freaking out about the fact you are fixing the engine from Charlotte to Orlando. #longday
@AmericanAir what's the point? So I can wait for another 6 weeks. U r one of the only airlines that refuses to handle complaints by phone
@united + that's the gist of what the flight attendant told her.
@USAirways any updates on flight 1917 from Philly to LA?  Been sitting at gate for close to 2 hours
@SouthwestAir sent
@AmericanAir Yes, it says my reservation cannot be retrieved at this time. Also I never got an email from AA saying my flight was Cancelled Flightled.
@AmericanAir @USAirways wonderful FC FA on flight 2062 pre dawn!  Nice start to the day!
@AmericanAir @dfwairport you 2 together are the best part of flying!
@united has once again let me down. Don't think I've ever flown with them and not had problems. Worst airline period.
@JetBlue u now have my gears grinding. The JFK baggage office told me I need to bring the bag back right now if not they will close my claim
@USAirways What is happening at Reagan Airport DCA? Long lines and four people working checkIn! #unhappy #DCA
@JetBlue I cheated on you, and I'm sorry. I'll never do it again. @SouthwestAir has given my wife and I the worst start to a honeymoon ever
@JetBlue so the prefference option is not something that you honor? So why having it as one of the services if not applied?
@usairways I have been on hold for over 3 hours.  Please help! http://t.co/tyXAZtMQ1U
@USAirways Only for one flight, though. The 2nd leg my kids are sitting scattered about the aircraft.
@SouthwestAir I'll do that. Can't DM until you follow me. Thanks!
@united Frontier is currently offering their weather exceptions for this weekend. When is United?
@united unavailable leg that registered hours after being sold out. Only option to offer after 45min was +$400/ticket or Travelocity (2of2)
@United  My bag is still in Colo Springs. I am disabled and have to search an unfamiliar airport and look for my bag. Not a good outcome
@united so if this game was the one reason I payed for @DIRECTV is there something we could work out here? http://t.co/HQDTK6aTue
@SouthwestAir sadly didn't get much help ... As a travel agent this is so disappointing to me.
@SouthwestAir I paid for inflight wifi only for it not to work. Download speed was 0.21mbps &amp; I ended up watching the free TV instead.
@SouthwestAir @TheAcademy party in #hotlanta http://t.co/x5ZQssJtRB
@JetBlue Hi. I'm trying to find a flight to the Middle East.
@AmericanAir @loganex except if you call now you'll get the same message. Trust me, I've tried.
@SouthwestAir allows other passengers 2 harass u after their gate agents mistakeFURIOUS they are doing NOTHING about it &amp; my 6yo was scared
@JetBlue hey me and my family have questions on a trip to Disney world that we are doing in April . Please follow me so I could dm you guys
@AmericanAir Will it be this year, do you think?
@united she was at the service desk at gate 21, and helped us find a flight to get us to our dest. on time when our flight got Cancelled Flightled
@united yea I saw that I'm moving to China and have 5-6 bags will pay whatever but wanted to make sure it was ok to bring that many
@united after 443min of avoidable non-weather delays that #Appreciation link better be giving out #GoldenTickets
@SouthwestAir What is the best credit card to use/open to get miles with y'all?
@SouthwestAir beautiful day in Seattle! http://t.co/iqu0PPVq2S
@united Home is Calgary can you get us there without the added expense of accommodations and meals.
@united thanks -- we filled it out. How's our luck with this? Is it common?
@united DM'd you 4 hrs ago at your request. No response to be found .... just like my bag.
@JetBlue what a great experience on flight from SFO to JFK; seats, service, food, everything is top quality. I will be back. Very soon!
@united Learn to hold connections. They texted me there is another flight Late Flightr - my connection hasn't left and were pulling into the gate
@SouthwestAir How to find out if my parents luggage really went to FLL on a Cancelled Flighted SW flight?  Called 1800IFlySWA, long long waits...
@united @AmericanAir spent hundreds to rectify the situation and you guys go quiet
@JetBlue try harder. Take a winners attitude to your work.
@AmericanAir Hey you Cancelled Flightled my flight, and I can't get someone on the phone to rebook (2 hour wait minimum). Can I get some service?
@JetBlue Beatriz and Susan. Gate 4 MCO.
@AmericanAir hour and a half after landing bags are finally trickling off. http://t.co/4KbTzVjU3b
@SouthwestAir not frustrated, just an idea! Great crew. Thanks! #happycustomer
@united noooooooooooooooooooooope.
@united customer service: 16hr delay coupon can only be redeemed on website which has $200 higher prices than Expedia, call wait time 55mins
@SouthwestAir 2 hours on hold for customer service never us SW again
@USAirways any word on whether or not flight 1971 from Seattle to Charlotte will have connections held? Or...
@USAirways job well done from your Philly employee running check,in today. (Tabitha?) helped us in an emergency &amp; vacation saved!!!
@USAirways They're also saying the CLT flights are delayed but you're not showing it in your system which makes it impossible to figure out
@AmericanAir you have the worst reps at Jacksonville airport. So rude and totally not helpful at all!
@united at what pt do u just Cancelled Flight!  Finally got stndby 4 1pm flight. What a day!  #missedWork #clientNotHappy http://t.co/sUPrLfOi8T
@SouthwestAir Yes but they couldn't explain the 2 hour and 45 minute hold time.
@VirginAmerica @virginmedia I'm flying your #fabulous #Seductive skies again! U take all the #stress away from travel http://t.co/ahlXHhKiyn
@AmericanAir I've been calling you for 3 straight days and no one picks up. Sure there are storms but there are also #customers Holler!
@JetBlue trying to charge us $550 dollars cash for tickets we paid for months in advance #isthisreal #nevertoldus #jetblue #NeverAgain
@USAirways And the lies continue. Just waited another hr to get boarding passes for flight supposedly created today which is now Cancelled Flightled?!
.@USAirways and then you said I could move my Thursday flight for free if I CALL A NUMBER. And then you HANG UP ON ME.
@USAirways When you are deciding to wreck a vacation... is losing luggage from a Cancelled Flighted flight your "go to" maneuver?
@SouthwestAir strives to be 'Customer Centric' in everything they do - communications, advertising, customer journey, etc. #ANAmarketers
@JetBlue should i continue?
Is expiring the @united offer to buy or transfer #United #MileagePlus miles with discount? Many offers during a year http://t.co/6tz6imqZlG
@united fire yr rep who refused to put me on a flight that I had a boarding pass and seat on. Full explanation and her name in complaint.
@united Was able to send the DM. All good now.
@SouthwestAir me &amp; @sammi_jon3s are best friends because of @Imaginedragons. Any chance we could get tickets to #DestinationDragons ?
@USAirways after pleading with car service to stay 3 hrs. past pick up they left me and my family but it's ok i have water and crackers!
@SouthwestAir that's bull. Once you add a fare to the cart you should be locked in. I made it all the way to PayPal.
@united thanks kp but luckily my transfer has maintenance issues and is still delayed so I didn't miss my transfer...
@united I just want shout out a thank the pilots and staff on the Feb 13 flight from Newark to Boston at 4:40pm.  They were super helpful!
.@united: Just landed. A day Late Flight with almost no sleep, but here. I feel sorry for the woman I consoled who's mother died during the night.
@AmericanAir Trip cut 7 hrs short due to flight change/massive layovers/ no peanuts or crackers/ asked for H2O and received about 2oz.
@SouthwestAir flight Cancelled Flightled out of BWI to PBI. Can't get out until Monday. What are the chances the seats open up for a flight on 2/22?
@JetBlue absolutely, my girlfriend and I will be Flight Booking Problems our Mexico flights in the next day or two, will send a Tweet when it's done!
@united Can someone assist me with my DM's? Waiting 1 hour on phone, 2 hours on Twitter.
@JetBlue so you guys lost my bag that had all my ski gear in it. I flew here from NYC to ski. Should I buy new stuff tomorrow? ...
@united but your system gave my seat away.now I'm 27L Economy! Not Econ + seat. How did you give my plus seat away?
@USAirways I have been trying to get through to a representative for 7 hours aboout my Cancelled Flightled flight. Have you simply given up?
@united just landed. Might want to check flight 304 plane from Houston. That sound was during takeoff &amp; landing http://t.co/QKquRagGoO
@united is the worst. Nonrefundable First class tickets? Oh because when you select Global/FC their system auto selects economy w/upgrade.
@SouthwestAir great. My flight is delayed three hours. Now my friend has to wait for me at the airport for hours on her birthday. üòíüëé
@USAirways @AmericanAir 9 empty seats open in 1st on AA1061. No upgrades for a U.S. Gold member? Would love consistent policies.
@AmericanAir , CHECK DM PLEASE!
@SouthwestAir Can you equip a 737 with flamethrowers and a snow plow?
@united Then you delete my return ticket to Europe and blame me for the now show? This airline is a joke. 3 times this happened now.3 times!
@united Made the upgrade list. Will fly 1st tomorrow (for 40 min) for the first time ever! üôå #StatusMatchPaidOff http://t.co/ATfRKp6goY
@jetblue offered me a complimentary drink for switching seats. Stewardess asked for my age &amp; I said 30. We giggled. #goodgenes #ilookyoung
@SouthwestAir thx. Make it right. Help Meagan Fouty Brancato fl#2771 dfw gate 4 preboard w/kids - b4 group A please. Please.
@USAirways Ann Marie at LGA is the best ticket agent ever! #excellentcustomerservice
@united Your new mileage policy is awful. Before, I might have paid slightly more for United because of miles. Now there's no difference.
@SouthwestAir when will the winners of #DestinationDragons be announced?
@AmericanAir I understand that but I'm hoping I can rectify this in advance. I would call but I am in AUH. I just need my one checked bag.
@JetBlue flight 691 from bos to Tampa takeoff 40 min Late Flight
@JetBlue should I bother contacting them? I already checked into my flight üòï
@united nope, they told us it was time for them to go home and to sleep at the airport. Even though they assured us we would get a room...
@united your worker told us not to call because we'd be talking to someone in Thailand...
@united hey! think someone could meet me with my book when I arrive at @loganairports at 10:30? It's yes please #amypoehler. Oscar took it.
@SouthwestAir nice work on the update!
@JetBlue oh. And thank you for responding
@AmericanAir cost me over 200 dollars because flight was Cancelled Flightled and couldn't even give me a food comp!! Fly @JetBlue @Delta they take
@SouthwestAir when will you have flight from DAL to PVD?
@JetBlue It drops 75 when i take off the other two people, and vice versa. back and forth.
@JetBlue toss this ticket...it's great PR and I'm sure every college student following me will be willing to rock out wit too üëÄüëÄ
@USAirways Thanks! Sent you DM re: baggage issues.
@USAirways how can a person go from number one on a standby list to number twelve in three hours?  Should I be super platinum diamond status
@united "federal regulation prohibits you being separated from your bag"...yet you lose our bag and that's okay
@SouthwestAir Thanks, Lindsey. Any idea when I'll get there?! Stuck in Denver and told to "listen to the intercom better".
@VirginAmerica Like http://t.co/VPqEm31XUQ
@SouthwestAir I understand. Wonderful "Miriam" in customer service who was able to reroute me... Got any rental car discounts?
@united Need to track lost luggage being shipped to me. Need ph # for human. Not automated 800-335-2247.
@AmericanAir @USAirways if this is how your merger is going to go, you fail! Huge probls w/comm on DFW storm. Cxld rtrn flts. NOT COOL!!!
@JetBlue - I did, but since I was stranded in SYR without a ride I missed the window of opportunity to have rights in this matter. (4 hours)
@SouthwestAir Thanks for helping my mom after @allegiantair wouldn't let her get on her plane in Orlando! You're the best! #customerservice
@United  great way to start my vacation with an on time departure! Looking forward to my global first class suite!
@AmericanAir Nah, just horrible dining options outside of club. Luckily Manuel in the Admirals can make a Bloody Mary.
@JetBlue of course I am!!‚úàÔ∏è
@USAirways Thks US #1786 2/19 PHL to FLL. Overall 1st class has improved with more food now on PHL to FLL and most crews are super.
@USAirways Secondary screenings, a piece of the plane missing... Anything you want to tell us?
@JetBlue I would like the actual email address so I can follow up. thank you.
@AmericanAir that's interesting-Agent told me so. Sadly, another booked passenger didn't make it to gate by push back so I made it on.
@united flight was too heavy so had to fly BACK to Palm Springs (after being in the air for 30 mins)
@AmericanAir - 6 months ago best catering out of all domestic airlines. Today. Worst on the planet. And I've flown almost all of them
@united A very disappointing experience - plane mech. delay and next one didn't wait. No sincere apology, just told me to complain online
@JetBlue the slowest boarding process I've ever experienced and rude customer service agents.
@JetBlue THANK YOU! I am your new big fan :)
@VirginAmerica I tried that. You offered to charge me an additional $1k for a new ticket or be stranded until Thurs. 1st time, last time.
@USAirways been at DCA at 5 pm still here at 3 am due to mechanical issues and lack of snacks on the plane! Absolutely worse experience!
@united You shouldn't page o'head that it's best to call 1-800# - on hold 26+ mins
@SouthwestAir been on hold for 30 min trying to rebook my flight you Cancelled Flightled. Help?!
@united more people stranded cause you suck. Better yet, you weasel out of Flight Booking Problems rooms for people claiming weather http://t.co/Flcnnn2USD
@SouthwestAir 4 flights Cancelled Flightled in one week?! Customer Service is üí©üí©üí©üí©
@SouthwestAir has the winner for #DestinationDragons been announced yet? If not when will they be??
@united I believe just customer service. At last post he was at Narita in Tokyo. They sent him to a motel to rest. Said standby maybe 2days
@JetBlue Indeed. It was not üòâ.
@united no thanks
@SouthwestAir flight Cancelled Flightled, stuck for 3 days. Paid for "A" boarding. Refused to honor it with rescheduled flight
‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/7iM9rHIvyR‚Äù Plz stop
@JetBlue Sent.
@sarahpompei don't bother wasting your time!  @USAirways will send u a form letter &amp; let u choose a gift certificate. #worstcustomerservice
@SouthwestAir app error - says click here, can't click not hyperlinked http://t.co/IH5w9nfKz2
@AmericanAir 3659 from SGF -&gt; DFW. You might want to clear off the ice for the planes landing. üò≥
@AmericanAir you have Cancelled Flightled my flights because of my last name. Do the right thing and reinstate my tickets
@SouthwestAir you are a bunch of liars! Cancelled Flightled our flight and rebooked us four days Late Flightr!
@USAirways Painless and effortless flight from Indy to PHL... Our flight attendant, Tory, was fantastic. Give that lady a raise ASAP!
@VirginAmerica best customer service rep in the world! #irmafromDallas takes the cake!!!
@united I was originally trying to share details but the link Jimmy Samartzis Vice President - Customer Experience sent me expired.
@SouthwestAir I know it is hard to predict, but how are flights from Dallas to Nashville tomorrow AM?
@JetBlue yes! Always a treat to fly with you guys! üòä‚úàÔ∏è
@SouthwestAir amazing service by your SW stewardesses! From den to Cun and from CUN to Atl and atl to lax. Thank u!

@SouthwestAir so, when your plane doesn't work the luxuries I paid for go away but you keep my money? I need that biz model.
@united I had to change airports to actually get a flight out when my flight from FAY was Cancelled Flightled twice. $180 taxi ride to RDU--reimburse?
@JetBlue won't see my money again after their poor service    should have stuck with virgin america what was i thinking trying jetblue???
@united So do I need to book two one ways in order for her to fly as an unaccompanied minor?
@united if guy on flight 1230 follows through on threat to sue because he couldn‚Äôt carry on 3 bags, I will defend you for free.
@AmericanAir Believe me, I understand. Flight #2955. Was originally booked for Sunday. Flight was Cancelled Flighted and rescheduled for today.

@USAirways 45 minutes and moved two feet in BZE. üëé http://t.co/AwGjkjIIac

@USAirways How soon is possible? I boarded the plane the 1st time at 6:30 am and it is now after 11:30 am and I'm still where I started.
@AmericanAir It's not your agents; it's your voice activated system that's not working right. And no email on Cancelled Flightlation. Lots of problems
@JetBlue Ive called you 3 x &amp; waited on hold 10 min each time to be disconnected each time. Enraging! I need to speak to someone! #help
.@united You may "dislike delays" but I paid you .We had an agreement that I paid you and you got me to my destination at a certain time.
@USAirways 4+ hour hold, finally Cancelled Flighted ticket! sticking to @delta @Expedia who allow easy online Cancelled Flights/refunds! http://t.co/RKVCZBpdCE

@SouthwestAir @Imaginedragons  Did they pick someone for Destination Dragons?
@united agent, "You should use the bathroom before boarding.. Toilets onboard are full." Oh you can expected a strongly worded email FUnited

@JetBlue should I be nervous about a Sunday AM flight Baltimore to Boston? Any suggestions on what I can do? Need to be in Boston by Monday.
@united so if I'm flying 1st class just one leg to Chicago but not on my long flight to China am I still able to use the lounge in Chicago
@AmericanAir just downloaded the app for iPhone.  Notice drink coupon but nothing is displayed?  Getting ready to fly...
@JetBlue okay thank you! I'll check with them again!
@USAirways @AmericanAir when is US Air switching to AA iOS app? AA app is much better.
@JetBlue after 40 mins they tell us they can't check temperature for at least 2 more hours. So it's back to the gate to wait. #mosiacfail
At the airport ready to get this @JetBlue red eye going.... Soooooo sleepy.  #NoPlaceLikeHome #eventhoughits2degreesathome

@AmericanAir instead of putting the burden on your customers do the right thing and get more gate agents.
@united UNBELIEVABLY DISAPPOINTED. DELAY AFTER DELAY. STOP MESSING WITH MY LIFE.
@united at the gate! IAD to RDU
@JetBlue why is t that every time I fly jfk even more speed doesn't work waiting for 10 min #nogood
@AmericanAir AA 100 - good job overselling this flight. Delayed 90 minutes to deplane the overflow passengers' bags.
@SouthwestAir : Hello..are flights taking off from @DallasLoveField airport this noon. Am supposed to travel on flight 376 to San antonio
@USAirways I've been on hold to change a date on a ticket for over 3 hours. Can someone please assist me? Unacceptable.
@JetBlue 118 to Boston still sitting
@JetBlue For one way, not letting me select TO city....strange...and now some fairs look "normal" ????
@USAirways  is a bag that is   23‚ÄùL x 9‚ÄùW x 12‚ÄùH  allowed as a carry on?
@USAirways truly dissapointed when our flight is delayed and going to miss connection that we are expected to rebook our own flight????????
@AmericanAir pretty lame response to a two paged single spaced letter http://t.co/aCebo6ELPa
@USAirways please fix the very unproductive check in process at @DCA. 20 check in stations and 2 people working them. What a total mess!!!!
@AmericanAir I did
@USAirways I was eventually given a flight to Memphis but only after I was taken off my original flight bc I was checked in as my father
@united tried a different flight IAH-MNL 4/1/15-4/17/15, 6 flights are advertised for $1038 but are not bookable (due to partner error).
@united it's been booked into first class with curbside delivery 24 hours from now. I'm counting on it! #TeamUSA
@united There must be 100 people waiting in line for customer service at DEN to deal with flight Cancelled Flightations.
@USAirways Thanks!
@united Direct Messaged you, didn't hear anything back
@AmericanAir Not here yet, but I plan on it. If you could have them fly low and slow right in front of me, that would be great. ;-)
@USAirways I am appalled. My departure with you was all messed up and now on return i am supposed to fly alone with two very sick kids
@united you board a 630a flight and then Cancelled Flight it because it doesn't have a pilot?  Now I miss my meeting Atlanta because someone slept in?
@AmericanAir The wine served in USAirways flights are watered down somehow right out of the bottles.
@USAirways: u didn't bother following up, we booked with @Delta.  @Delta understands cust srv: provided lunch 4 delays &amp; upgraded seats!
@USAirways u would think if u were going to Cancelled Flight my flight, you'd rebook our seats to something other than the last row. #usairwaysfail
@USAirways did you know that suicide is the second leading cause of death among teens 10-24
@SouthwestAir Why can we no longer change trips with a companion online? Been doing it for years, now get message can't be done online?
@JetBlue Not really. I have a flight to catch at 1 pm in Vegas. I'm praying I don't miss the flight!
@JetBlue is flight 51 on 4/24/15 moved back? When I booked it said we arrive 11:31 but now it says 12:08 üò¢
@JetBlue No, it's weird!! I picked other cities just to test, those worked...not the one I want. Works on phone though, so I'll use that.
@JetBlue Kudos to JetBlue social media team for jumping in an helping me out during the last snow storm while web site was down..Thanks!!
@united nope. Called, lost the seating preference I paid for, and here I still sit. We'll see what happens w/ my flight Late Flightr.
@united + UA has been rolling out improvements too, we think. Hoping they'll catch up soon? Meantime, ANA is our preference!
@USAirways - been on hold for more than 2.5 hours - this after not getting through after 2 hours on hold this morning with no answer - help!
@AmericanAir Rebooked for tomorrow morning. Never been here - not sure what I can see before tomorrow morning!
@united Wife and I have two new destinations and I'm stuck in DC until Monday with no bags
@VirginAmerica Thanks so much for the awesome support, you guys rock!
@JetBlue do you have a waiver for NY weather today?
@AmericanAir I've never had anything bad to say until now. No love for faithful customers.
@USAirways I left an item on plane BOS-PHL on Friday.  I've called PHL US Airways # &amp; left 6 msgs. No return call what to do at this point.
@united flight from san fransico to jfk was evacuated why?
@USAirways never fails to disappoint.
@USAirways Done
@united @gg8929 Ladies and gents - United Airlines...
@united &amp; on top of no free tv on the int‚Äôl leg, now I‚Äôm sitting on the Tarmac in Houston, 70 min past departure w/ another hr plus to go
@united it's not there we tried. It's already here in cancun just no one has delivered it
@USAirways / @AmericanAir are incompetent.
@AmericanAir Why can't you handle your customers needs? Cancelled Flightled flight, 800 number leads to a quick "Goodbye" Very Sad!
@AmericanAir If you care, could you have someone call me to explain what is going on.
@USAirways Delays due to faulty engine light. Great work guys. Coming up on 2 hrs sitting on the plane #WorstAirlineInAmerica
@united Cancelled Flightled my flight for some unknown reason and haven't really given me anything to make my overnight layover tolerable
@USAirways - thanks however I feel like the system has failed me -- what is the solution?
@united give me an email address and I'll send the actually screen shot to you.
@united Help! My girlfriend Amy Lloyd is going to miss our flt to Zurich bc of your fault. She needs a golf cart to meet her at ORD (1)
@SouthwestAir I'm upset because we were lied to. Was told ice on runway, but EVERY other carrier was able to fly. Airport confirmed no ice!
@AmericanAir tell me you can get me to ABI earlier than 8 pm tomorrow
@SouthwestAir Thanks Lindsey &amp; the Southwest twitter team for great service &amp; a speedy resolution #LuvAgent #swa
@SouthwestAir   A whole family, with a special Olympic athlete here, and you can't even call them? 617-653-3040
@united the most frustrating flying experience. One continuous "I dunno what time you will leave today. ". Dunno?! That's code for ...?
@SouthwestAir Repeating this is policy is basically repeating "Fuck you" to your customers. I'll be shopping for a new airline ASAP
@USAirways No. Just felt that you could do better in making the emails feel a little less of ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt care. We‚Äôre automated."
@USAirways I have a story for you. It starts with a two hour delayed flight that makes me miss my connection in Miami.
@USAirways yes thanks I have never seen anything like this and I come to Yuma all the time, big disappointment. There are 40+ still waiting
@JetBlue ok thanks. Safety first.
@USAirways I know that, thanks. Evaluate further ;-) ... -Chairman
@SouthwestAir is America's largest airline by passengers carried! Wonder if this is b/c they have a 'Customer Service Bible' #ANAmarketers
@JetBlue thank you!
@JetBlue please provide me your direct email for me to explain.
@USAirways my luggage was delayed. I'm looking for compensation, since, you know, you charged me for it then forgot it...
@SouthwestAir No worries at all!!! I would rather be safe on the ground than take any chances. Yes! Tomorrow AM if BNA reopens ‚ò∫Ô∏è
@JetBlue you're flight attendants suck and are always rude :( 4th bad experience with JetBlue tonight :/
@USAirways lost our luggage. #yay
@united i will just send my confirmation number when I get home safe and sound. This is why i pay so expensive services to you!
@AmericanAir that's unacceptable
@USAirways so I get bumped to the 6pm to Birmingham which is now delayed because the pilots scheduled don't have enough hours together. Fail
@USAirways thanks
@united you asked me to DM then ignore them. Please assist in changing to another flight today- 21 Feb fra to mco avoiding IAD.
@USAirways won't waive $200 fee due to #neptune. Can't use credit w/o paying fee. Couldnt get to destination to use their tic #waivethefee
@united Yeah, bag is on the way. As per usual.  I'm actually getting used to getting it delivered to me, its kind of nice in a sense.
@AmericanAir I was happy to purchase the upgrade. If only it was avail on my next flight.
@SouthwestAir broke the stroller my wife and baby gate checked. They told her it's not their problem. Calling the A List Preferred line now.
@SouthwestAir can one use a companion pass w/ a points Flight Booking Problems or is it only cash fares? Thx!
@SouthwestAir Yes, but I like need my luggage before tomorrow morning
@united Thanks, ^KP. Please also mention the Quiche breakfast and Tandoori chicken dinner entrees and accompaniments are truly First Class.
@AmericanAir been on hold for for over two hours. After waiting 2 hours earlier. Can't get any info on my reservation. How is that ok?
@AmericanAir try contacting everyone on that flight with a refund offer and we might believe you are sincere
@united thanks for that advice, so helpful. Can't believe you guys actually charge people to "fly" united
@AmericanAir flight from DC to LA, not to mention fix the circuit breaker in our bathrooms because this plane is as old as me...
@USAirways woohoo! He still has 1 more flight but so happy to hear they're in the air, just about cried! (Must be the preggo hormones!) thx!
@AmericanAir Hi. I have KOA-LAX-PHL-ORD booked as a 1-way savr awrd. If I called to chnge it to KOA-LAX-PHX-ORD would I have to pay any fees
@JetBlue thanks! Yes! order me a rum and coke and get me a hotel voucher because the floor and chairs aren't so cushy here...!
@united no claim number. Haven't been back to iAd baggage since. Is there a phone I can call to speak to someone?
@united haha that's fine. Still won't fly @united ever again. Seems like you guys have more problems than anyone else.
@united no thanks
@JetBlue sure is üíô
@AmericanAir Hello, question, How many balloons do you think it will take to life up one of your planes?
@united What's going on with your website? I'm Flight Booking Problems three tickets today and I've been booted off the system umpteen times.
@SouthwestAir Thank you for the prompt response. I will email Late Flightr today.
@USAirways TRBL experience! 2 hrs on the Tarmac for an inch of snow IN PHL "No hanger open" &amp; "a pile of snow"?  #terriblecommunication
@USAirways awesome... Doors close in 2 minutes, flight leaves in 17 minutes... And the plane just got here. WTH?
@united In ORD, waited 20 min after crew members left before gate items came. Flight attendant sarcastically said good luck and walked away.
@JetBlue if there is a "processing error" the  why do you send out full flight tickets and confirmations? #FlySouthwest
@AmericanAir all right, but can you give me an email to write to ?
@AmericanAir @USAirways you can help by now finding my baggage!!  Reply to me ASAP with who I can direct details to.
@united what do you have in mind?
@united I sent my details to the customer care link you sent me almost a month ago and no response.
@united worst agents in US at Ft. Lauderdale Airport; passengers stand in line, getting status alerts &amp; still didn't make an announcement
You know what ... RT ‚Äú@JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/WJYAs2D94n‚Äù
@USAirways what is wrong in Boston? Why are only your plains not leaving tonight? Son needs to get back to state college, PA
@AmericanAir Also, I have to wait more than 2 hours before I can speak to someone on the phone?  I can't wait 2 hours.  :(
@united delayed going home AGAIN. Getting really tired of delays.
@USAirways this has been the worst trip with little to no customer service
@JetBlue I would like to communicate directly with a "Customer Experience" executive. Does Joanna Geraghty have an email address?
@AmericanAir Cancelled Flighted our flight and now are still delayed...NOT COOL.
@SouthwestAir Disappointed in the FAA "regulation" you have 2 furnish proof of age 4 toddler. Thx for the unnecessary headache. #flyUnited
@USAirways it's flt 4827 to ELM - still no gate and still have to make it thru customs
@JetBlue Awesome! #bestairlineever
STAHHPPP!!! RT @JetBlue: Our fleet's on fleek. http://t.co/VHFJGneOZO
@USAirways No access to Dividend Miles and for a week the automated phone keeps telling me to call back Late Flightr. #FRUSTRATED #LivePersonPlease
@USAirways - what a disaster! Flight 3739, missed passenger count by 5 since it was done manually!!  Really???
@USAirways tells me to talk to @AmericanAir about my delayed flights. AA tells me to talk to US. #ihatemergers
@united even though technically after I land I will be silver?
@united they held the flight for our group of nearly 20 people.
@SouthwestAir you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016
@USAirways @BohnJai they lost my bag @PHL baggage handlers broke open my bag and stole my camera
@JetBlue A320 pulling into the gate as the sunrises here at @BostonLogan this morning #jetbluesofly #jetblue #airbus http://t.co/JGdu5us8Dz
@united #albanyairport delayed departure to check bags at gate claiming space filled and walk on to open spaces a delay #poorcustomerservice
@USAirways great job today In ruining 45 people's vacation. Thanks to your incompetent pilot and staff we have all now missed our flights
@USAirways once again your service leaves a lot to be desired. Flight 5141 here early, but short staffing means we wait on Tarmac...Thanks
@SouthwestAir Do y'all know when the new routes from HOU to Aruba &amp; Puerto Vallarta will be available?
@USAirways And really, it's a middle initial versus middle name. All else the same. Not spending my time on your computer issues.
@USAirways now on hold for 2 hrs 20 min. This is ridiculous
@united hoping to get out earlier than 2/23 (only phone option) or assistance with hotel.
@VirginAmerica should use this in their next airline commercial lol :: http://t.co/pXEXIlSjBs
@USAirways thanks
@JetBlue thank you
@SouthwestAir hey southwest! Help me find a flight from Nashville - Washington DC or Raleigh for under $150 on March 15 please!
@SouthwestAir Fastest response all day. Hour on the phone: never got off hold. Hour in line: never got to the Flight Booking Problems desk.
@USAirways He overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled. You should refund me I had no Choice. #Grossedout
@USAirways Now going on 26 minutes on hold.
@SouthwestAir apologies help. Would have been nice had supvsr. Sally in CLE offered one. Not usual gr8 southwest customer service I love
@JetBlue I hope so because I fly very often and would hate to change airlines.
@JetBlue glad u happy I have my bag but as a traveler I entrusted u w/ my property &amp; u return it damaged &amp; that's the best answer u have?
@AmericanAir yes there's issues on the site as well unfortunately.
@VirginAmerica Why is it taking 12 years to fly home to Dallas? Get your shit together.
@USAirways @AmericanAir shout out to Diane at EYW for helping get us home today instead of tomorrow (even if a little Late Flight!)
@united is the worst
@SouthwestAir.   50th Anniversary on April 10th. Still. Sweethearts.  Companions.  Lifetime.  Sons.  Families. Love.
@SouthwestAir up at 4AM and arrive to find it already Cancelled Flighted. No options so miss my meeting. You might "know" but don't show it.
@USAirways Flight US 723 from @DublinAirport to @PHLAirport passing over @LoveLoughNeagh at 20,000 ft this morning. http://t.co/FRd0cAy6DA
@SouthwestAir show me some love and a companion flight~please and thank you!
@VirginAmerica Atlantic ploughs a lone furrow in the #MiddleEast http://t.co/DCoBoKN7EE @TheNationalUAE
@USAirways. R U aware your wait time to talk to a sales agent is always 30-60 minutes? Unacceptable. At least employ a call back feature!
@USAirways Also, get excited, because he's going to be unable to contact you all from his destination, so you get to talk to me.
@USAirways sucks.  Flt 2692 Late Flight by 20 mins missed my connection.  Thanks for the 10 bucks and a middle seat on the next flt.
@united thanx so much. You followed through and emailed me a $1000 ticket voucher. #unitedairlines they do care
@united is to airlines as @comcast @XFINITY is to cable/internet
@united I was protected on that flight by gate agent Kerry at LAS. She also did an excellent job getting me to my destination today. Thanks!
@united Thanks so much , my passport was recovered
@AmericanAir Hey AA, a suggestion: Note on your seat maps what seats have electronics box blocking legroom. AA215 http://t.co/hcNN0wXQQr
@USAirways can you help us figure out our correct six digit confirmation number?
@JetBlue could I get a free flight to Vegas since it's my bdayüòè‚ò∫Ô∏è
@united has the best pilots ever Thank you guys for the great trip #thatisall
@JetBlue just a heads up, this page no longer exists http://t.co/NsJWVTTjGo
@AmericanAir I want to speak to a human being! !!  This is not an obscene request!
@AmericanAir we have 8 ppl so we need 2 know how many seats are on the next flight. Plz put us on standby for 4 people on the next flight?
@JetBlue if I had my tux, it'd be a date! #UMosaicMeCrazy http://t.co/hap4gboSTU
@JetBlue was just at T5 a little over a month ago. @JetBlue you guys are great thanks for everything!
@AmericanAir why don't you have driver service to get employees to work in bad weather like hospitals etc #badmgmt #AmericanAirlines
@SouthwestAir customer service is rude and bothered by our calls. Has no idea what is going on and sighed heavily on the phone. Unbelievable
@united you have now lost my bag. Never ever flying United again #joke
@VirginAmerica come back to #PHL already. We need you to take us out of this horrible cold. #pleasecomeback http://t.co/gLXFwP6nQH
@USAirways you guys have to be the worst. We are flying into Philadelphia and have only two jetways available for an on time plane.#pisspoor
@united with about 25 people trying to get on flights
@SouthwestAir almost at the gate for 1156 to SF. Please wait 60 more seconds.
@AmericanAir I'm trying to register since 12:00,don't want to be separated from my brother during the15hours flight!There're few places left
@USAirways thanks for reaching out to me.  My Gold Div no. 2k424j0. My Flights were changed under Confirmation # DNX58V.
@SouthwestAir, what do you know? Finally lined up like cattle to board my SW flight (after original departure time) #badcustomerservice
@united hence why I've been asking for the customer service phone number so I can speak to a real person to get this sorted out
@USAirways @AmericanAir 28 hours Late Flightr still no email. work supervisor needs documentation to approve last minute vacation day request
